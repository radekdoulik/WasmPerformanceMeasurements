    Remove StackPush/Pop suffix from helper names (#68099)
    
    Originally these were local functions, which don't support overloads, so we used numerical suffixes to differentiate them.  Now that they're proper methods on a helper type, we no longer need the suffixes and they can be pure overloads, which makes the code a bit easier to read.
    
    Also, local functions don't currently support XML comments, so we used regular comments on these helpers.  Now that they're regular methods, welcome back XML comments.
