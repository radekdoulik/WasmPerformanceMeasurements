    JIT: Optimize expansion of indir cell addresses for CFG (#70491)
    
    On ARM64 it is expensive to materialize the address of an indirection
    cell since that requires multiple instructions. This is particular a
    problem when CFG is enabled where validation + call uses the indir cell
    twice. This changes the CFG logic to create a local in this case.
    
    We also were forcing the indir cell argument node into the register.
    This is not ideal for this particular case, so remove this logic and let
    LSRA deal with it. ARM still needs this logic.
    
    Fix #65076
