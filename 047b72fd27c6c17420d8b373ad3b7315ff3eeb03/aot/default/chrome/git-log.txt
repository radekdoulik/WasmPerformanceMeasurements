    fixes in transition blowup and removing recursion from RegexNode conversion (#68307)
    
    * partially fixing transition blowup and removing recursion from ConvertToSymbolicRegexNode
    
    * simplified switch statement to avoid essentially duplicate code
    
    * simplified conversion and generalized doubly link list a bit, removed implicit constraint on RegexNode uniqueness
    
    * optimizing a bit: avoiding x=pop();push(x) sequence by using peek
    
    * fixed comments
    
    * sealing some classes that needed to be sealed
