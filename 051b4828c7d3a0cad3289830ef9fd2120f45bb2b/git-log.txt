    Fix bug in Tar preventing extraction of hardlinks or entries starting with `.\` (#70853)
    
    * Add PlatformDetection.SupportsHardLinkCreation property.
    
    * Fix how paths are combined/joined and sanitized on extraction, to ensure paths with redundant segments get properly handled.
    
    * Add tests that verify archives with entries whose paths start with .\, including the root folder itself.
    
    * Re-enable the hardlink test, condition it to not run if platform does not support extraction of hardlinks.
    
    * Remove unnecessary test - This same code is already being tested by TarReader_ExtractToFile_Tests.ExtractEntriesWithSlashDotPrefix
    
    * Reuse test code that retrieves memory stream.
    
    * Bump test data package version
    
    * Add missing typeof(PlatformDetection) in ConditionalFact
