    [mono][aot] Fix compilation crashes when type load exception is generated in code (#110078)
    
    * [mono][aot] Fix stack state when emitting type load throw
    
    Method compilation was continuing and we ended up failing with invalid IL.
    
    * [mono][aot] Mark clauses as dead when replacing method code with exception throw
    
    In the final stages of method compilation, when trying to compute clause ranges, we were asserting because the clause bblocks haven't been reached for compilation.
