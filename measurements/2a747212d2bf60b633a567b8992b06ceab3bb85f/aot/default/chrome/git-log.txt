    [Mono] Fix Mono Windows x86 build and runtime crash. (#74639)
    
    Fix Mono Windows x86 build and runtime crash.
    
    Trying to validate a fix on x86 Windows Mono crashed runtime with
    stack overflow. After some investigation it turns out that Mono
    Windows x86 have SIMD disabled, but S.P.C was still build with
    System.Runtime.Intrinsics support and implementation of methods
    like get_IsSupported is implemented as follow:
    
    .method public hidebysig specialname static
            bool  get_IsSupported() cil managed
    {
      // Code size       6 (0x6)
      .maxstack  8
      IL_0000:  call       bool System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Popcnt::get_IsSupported()
      IL_0005:  ret
    } // end of method Popcnt::get_IsSupported
    
    causing a stack overflow when called at runtime.
    
    Fix make sure we won't add support for System.Runtime.Intrinsics
    in S.P.C for Mono Windows x86 builds.
    
    There was also a warning in debugger-agent.c when building debug
    that caused build to fail, including fix for that as well.
