    ProcessTests: allow WorkingSet to be zero just after launching the process. (#85649)
    
    * ProcessTests: allow WorkingSet to be zero just after launching the process.
    
    The WorkingSet tests fail on Fedora 38+ because a zero working set value
    is observed just after the process start.
