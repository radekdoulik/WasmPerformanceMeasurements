    Improve and unify debug views of dictionaries. (#92534)
    
    * Improves and unifies debug views of dictionaries.
    
    The change alows generic and non-generic dictionaries to be displayed in the same way: with separate columns for keys and values with an ability to expand each column.
    
    Fixes #88736
    
    * Fix the DebuggerView tests of dictionaries
    
    Included non-generic dictionaries in tests
    
    * Fix more DebuggerView tests
    
    * Included more types that implement IDictionary in the DebuggerView tests.
    * Improved the testing code to support classes with attributes declared by their base classes.
    * Fixed .Net Framework 4.8 build error by removing a dependency on the record c# feature.
    * Fixed tests remaining tests (outside of the System.Collections subset)
    
    * Fix DebugView.Tests build errors on .Net Framework
    
    * Update DebugView tests to expect different outcomes on .Net Framework
    
    .Net Framwork does not support recent improvements in the way the debugger displays a dictionary. Depending on the framwork used, the debugger view of generic dictionaries and ListDictionaryInternal are different.
    
    * Applied suggested changes and fixes
    
    * mostly code style changes
    * restored a rest for an empty HashSet.
    * fixed testing of the generic SortedList.
    
    * Minor improvents
    
    Renamed an internal method to match its new behavior and removed unnecessary init accessors.
