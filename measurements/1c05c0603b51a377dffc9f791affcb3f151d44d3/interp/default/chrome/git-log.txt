    JIT: profile checking through loop opts (#99367)
    
    Keep profile checks enabled until after we have finished running the
    loop optmizations (recall this is currently just checking for edge
    likelihood consistency).
    
    Fix various maintenance issues to make this possible. Most are straightforward,
    but a few are not:
    * Whenever we create a new BBJ_COND we have to figure out the right
    likelihoods. If we're copying an existing one (say loop inversion) we currently
    duplicate the likelihoods. This is a choice, and it may not accurately
    represent what happends, but we have no better information.
    * If we invent new branching structures we need to put in reasonable
    likelihoods. For cloning we assume flowing to the cold loop is unlikely
    but can happen.
    
    Block weights and edge likelihoods are not yet consistent. The plan is
    to get all the edge likelihoods "correct" and self-consistent, and then
    start rectifying edge likelihoods and block weights.
    
    Contributes to #93020.
