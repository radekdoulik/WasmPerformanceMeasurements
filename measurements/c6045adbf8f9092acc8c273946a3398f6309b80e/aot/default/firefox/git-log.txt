    * Applying formatting patch
    
    * Ensure BuildOperandUses handles CreateScalarUnsafe being contained
    
    * Ensure CreateScalarUnsafe is only contained for regOptional when the op1 type is a floating-point
    
    * Directly check that op1 is contained/regOptional
    
    * Ensure FusedMultiplyAdd rechecks CreateScalarUnsafe containment after removing NEG nodes
    
    * Ensure BroadcastScalarToVector doesn't regress containable scenarios
