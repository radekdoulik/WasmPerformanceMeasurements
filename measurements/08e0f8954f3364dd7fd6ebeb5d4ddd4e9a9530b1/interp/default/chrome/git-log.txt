    Use IndexOf for bounded loops in a regex (#101899)
    
    Today with a pattern like `ab*c`, IndexOfAnyExcept('b') will be used to skip past the `b`s. But if that pattern is changed to `ab{0, 1000}c`, we'll end up manually iterating, as the current specialization only handles unbounded loops. This adds the minor improvements necessary to also enable using IndexOf for bounded loops.
