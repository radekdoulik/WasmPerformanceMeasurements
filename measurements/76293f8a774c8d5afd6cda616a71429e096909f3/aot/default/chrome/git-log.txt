    Changed GetNetworkInterfaces method to to retrieve information related to all interfaces (#100824)
    
    * Add IncludeAllInterfaces as falg to reterive all avaliable interfaces including disabled ones
    
    * Update tests to accommodate new adapters. Ensure adapters reflect proper speeds; non-positive speeds indicates absence of physical address.
    
    * Removed unnecessary assertion
    
    * Add assertion over physical address bytes
