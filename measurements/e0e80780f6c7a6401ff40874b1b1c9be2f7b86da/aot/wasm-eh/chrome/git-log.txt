    JIT: treat synthesized profile data as pgo data, fix finally weights (#83185)
    
    Once synthesis arrives on the scene, we're not going to want phases in the JIT
    to arbitrarily modifying block weights. There is already a guard of this sort
    for regular profile data, so it makes sense to extend that to synthesized data
    as well.
    
    When synthesizing counts, propagate counts to finallies from the associated
    trys. This needs to be done carefully as we have make sure not to visit the
    finally until the count in the try is set. We rely on some of the properties
    of DFS pre and post number bracketing to do this efficiently, without needing
    to track extra state.
    
    Contributes to #82964.
