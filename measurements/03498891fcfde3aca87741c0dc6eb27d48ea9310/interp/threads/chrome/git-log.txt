    JIT: implied Boolean range assertions for local prop (#109481)
    
    If morph sees an assignment of 0/1 to a local, have it generate a [0..1] range
    assertion in addition to the constant assertion.
    
    This helps morph propagate more Boolean ranges at merges, which allows morph to
    elide more casts.
    
    Also, bump up the local assertion table size since morph is now generating more
    assertions.
