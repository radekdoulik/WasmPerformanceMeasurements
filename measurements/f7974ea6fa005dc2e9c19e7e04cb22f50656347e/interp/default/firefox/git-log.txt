    JIT_CountProfile: Avoid BSR instruction for low counts (#110258)
    
    The JIT_CountProfile32 and JIT_CountProfile64 functions used BitScanReverse functions to compute the log2 of counters, and then compare that to a threshold. This changes it so that the counter is directly compared to `1<<threshold` instead.
