    Fix argument passing of structs with padding on x86 (#108867)
    
    When passing a struct by value on x86, we copy its value to the stack.
    Sometimes this is done one field at a time, if the struct has been
    promoted. If there is padding between the fields (to create appropriate
    field alignment), then that padding needs to be zeroed.
    
    The bug is a case where there is padding between an earlier `double`
    field and a later, larger, SIMD field. We push 4-byte zeros but the code thinks
    it is pushing 8-byte zeros. The fix is simply to correctly calculate the number
    of zeros to push.
    
    Fixes #106140
