    Vectorize TensorPrimitives.CosineSimilarity<Half> (#116898)
    
    Vectorize for Half by processing it as shorts, using the existing widening routine to two vectors of floats, and operating on those floats. Even for non-vectorized, this improves throughput as each intermediate operation is operating on floats rather than constantly needing to convert back to Half.
