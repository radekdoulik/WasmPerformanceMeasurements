    Fix AREA alignment warning on Windows ARM64 (#84020)
    
    The arm64 build on Windows is warning about ALIGN instruction in the
    asmhelpers.asm having alignment larger than the alignment of the current
    area. This change fixes it by replacing TEXTAREA by an area with the
    proper alignment set.
