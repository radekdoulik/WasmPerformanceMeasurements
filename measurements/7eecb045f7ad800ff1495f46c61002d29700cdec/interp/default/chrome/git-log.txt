    JIT: Remove switch recognition fallthrough quirk (#109796)
    
    Part of #107749. Removes the last "TODO-NoFallThrough" in the JIT source. During switch recognition, we should only need to modify flow edges -- changing the lexical order of blocks to create fallthrough into one of the switch's successors is unnecessary, now that we're running block layout in the backend.
