    Add support for doubly nested intrinsic classes (#105761)
    
    `System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Avx10v1+V512+X64.IsSupported` currently results
    in an infinite loop. This PR fixes the problem by adding support in various
    places for hardware intrinsic classes nested more than once.
    
    - Expand `getMethodNameFromMetadata` to allow returning names of multiple
      enclosing classes
    - Expand the type loader to recognize intrinsics in up to 2x nested classes
    - Fix the JIT recognition to handle potentially multi-nested intrinsic classes
    - Fix NAOT support for opportunistically querying for `Avx10v1` support
    
    Fix #105402
