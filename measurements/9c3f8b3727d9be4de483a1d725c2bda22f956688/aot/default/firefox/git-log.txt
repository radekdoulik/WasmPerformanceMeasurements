    Windows executables: only load imported DLLs from System32 (#89311)
    
    By using the /DEPENDENTLOADFLAG link.exe flag, we can tell the Windows loader to only look for referenced DLLs in the System32 directory.
    
    The application of PGO is commented out until updated PGO files are available.
