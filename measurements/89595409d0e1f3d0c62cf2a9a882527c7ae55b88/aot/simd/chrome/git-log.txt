    Generate fewer templates for generic virtual methods (#80600)
    
    The only reason left why we needed the extra template was because when we're breaking down a `RuntimeMethodHandle` into components, we were trying to break it down into `RuntimeTypeHandle`s. But what we need is a `MethodDesc`. So shortcut the codepath that computes `MethodDesc`, then breaks it down into various type handles and then get a `MethodDesc` again.
