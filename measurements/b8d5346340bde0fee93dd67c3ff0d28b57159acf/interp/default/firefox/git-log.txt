    [wasm] pinvoke improvements part 2 (#98250)
    
    * InlineArray is supported in wasm pinvokes, and in general works correctly in mono marshaling now (it was broken on all targets)
    * fixed arrays are supported in wasm pinvokes
    *struct arguments and return values are supported in more wasm pinvoke scenarios
    * wasm struct scalarization is more intelligent about noticing padding and size mismatches in structs (without this, some inlinearrays would be scalarized incorrectly)
    * Prevent infinite recursion in build task's TypeToChar
    * expand WBT coverage
