    JIT: fix non-funclet EH empty finally/fault removal (#109361)
    
    For non-funclet EH we don't use the handler index to constrain the placement
    of add code descs, but we were still recording the handler index in the ACD.
    
    This lead to some errors in ACD maintenance if there was an EH region
    being removed with an ACD in the try and an equivalent one in the handler.
    
    Fixes #108851
