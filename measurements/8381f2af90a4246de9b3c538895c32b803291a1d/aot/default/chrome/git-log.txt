    Prevent OS core dump creation for intentionally crashing tests (#113732)
    
    * Prevent OS core dump creation for intentionally crashing tests
    
    There are three coreclr tests that intentionally run a crashing secondary
    process. While the CreateDump invocation on crash for these tests was
    already disabled, the OS core dump creation was still happening.
    In the CI this was causing test machines getting out of disk space.
    This change disables OS core dump creation for those tests.
    
    Close #113652
    
    * Reflect PR
    
    * call the setrlimit explicitly on Linux / macOS only
    * fix missing reference to the CoreCLRTestLibrary.csproj in the ParallelCrash.csproj.
      I have accidentally put it into ParallelCrashTester.csproj instead.
    
    * Update src/tests/Common/CoreCLRTestLibrary/Utilities.cs
