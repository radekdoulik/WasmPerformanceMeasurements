    JIT: Move VN-based intrinsic expansion later (#106750)
    
    This avoids making CFG changes before IV opts, which relies on many
    flowgraph related annotations. For example, this expansion will create
    new basic blocks with empty liveness sets that IV opts potentially could
    end up querying.
