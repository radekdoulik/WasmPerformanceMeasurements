    SPMI: Ensure we disable loop alignment consistently (#82100)
    
    Recently we disabled loop alignment in SPMI diffs, but this was only
    done for the SPMI invocations when we generate disassembly. This would
    result in the diffs run seeing different generated code than subsequent
    disassembly runs.
    
    This splits the environment variables we want to have enabled in the
    diffs SPMI invocation out into its own dictionary. These are force
    overridden.
