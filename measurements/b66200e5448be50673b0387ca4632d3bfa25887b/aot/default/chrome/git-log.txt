    Update DynamicallyAccessedMembers annotation on EventSource (#110001)
    
    This takes advantage of #109814. This is in theory a breaking change in case someone took advantage
    of our annotation and is doing their own reflection on `EventSource` descendants.
    
    Someone else reflecting on EventSource is problematic however. We placed around various suppressions
    due to our own annotations like this:
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0d62887a30553b8177dc90f9e39559be0e6c7707/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Diagnostics/Tracing/EventSource.cs#L414-L424
    
    It means that if someone else is reflection-accessing these, they would not get a trimming warning.
    Hopefully, nobody does that. This PR also assumes that nobody does that (and the PR should therefore
    not be breaking in practice).
    
    We annotate the class for our purposes, but someone else could be taking advantage of that in their own code.
