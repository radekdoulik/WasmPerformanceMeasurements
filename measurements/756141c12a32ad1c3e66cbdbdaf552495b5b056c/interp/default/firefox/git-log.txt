    [ILLink analyzer] Add analyzer support for feature checks (#94944)
    
    Adds support for annotating static boolean properties with
    `[FeatureCheckAttribute(typeof(RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute))]`,
    causing the property to be treated as a guard for analyzer
    warnings about the corresponding `Requires` attribute.
    
    Adds two new warnings for:
    
    - Invalid use of `FeatureCheckAttribute` applied to a non-static
      or non-bool property
    
    - Implementation of the property doesn't obviously satisfy
      the "guard property" (it should return false whenever the
      guarded feature is disabled).
    
    See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/94625 for notes on the design.
    See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96859 for the API proposal.
