    [android][ios] Add SDK and workload to support library mode (#83487)
    
    Introduces the experimental workload mobile-librarybuilder-experimental that supports building self-contained shared or static native libraries on iOS and Android.
    
    Once installed, the workload can be activated when the runtime identifier is android, ios, tvos, or maccatalyst based and the project contains the property <NativeLib>true</NativeLib>. NativeLib is a property NativeAOT uses to activate library mode and we will use that for consistency.
    
    The Microsoft.NET.Runtime.LibraryBuilder.Sdk is a new nuget package will contain all of the necessary msbuild props and targets that drive the whole library builder process.
