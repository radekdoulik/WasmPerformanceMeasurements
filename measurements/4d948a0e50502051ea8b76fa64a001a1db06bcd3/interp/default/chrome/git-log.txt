    Optimize Random{NumberGenerator}.GetItems for power-of-two choices (#92229)
    
    * Optimize Random{NumberGenerator}.GetItems for power-of-two choices
    
    When possible, make a single call to get the required randomness rather than one per element.

    Use separate scratch buffer instead of destination buffer. Upside, we don't need to be concerned about temporarily corrupt Ts, and it can work for managed Ts. Downside, it requires separate scratch space, which means an ArrayPool rental for larger sizes.
    
    * Address PR feedback, again
    
    Loop over a stackalloc'd buffer rather than using ArrayPool
    
    * Tweak test to validate variable number of choices
