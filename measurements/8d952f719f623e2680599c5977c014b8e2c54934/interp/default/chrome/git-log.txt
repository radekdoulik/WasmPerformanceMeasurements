    Don't inline methods with the DoesNotReturn attribute in interp, it's a waste of time to do so (#99550)
    
    Right now the mono interp will attempt to inline methods that have the DoesNotReturn attribute; this is a waste of time and resources, since it's not profitable to inline them and they are virtually always going to be unreachable code anyway.
