    [mono][wasm] marshal-ilgen is dropped when not required (#86035)
    
    * Replicating naricc's PInvokeScanner.
    
    * MarshalingPInvokeScanner now detects and outputs incompatible assemblies.
    
    * Allowing void return type.
    
    * PInvoke
    
    * Two-pass searching in progress.
    
    * Second pass resolves inconclusive types.
    
    * Cleanup.
    
    * Modifying the wasm toolchain to omit marshal-ilgen when possible.
    
    * Hopefully fix incorrect app dir.
    
    * Added definitions to MarshalingPInvokeScannerPath hopefully where needed.
    
    * Adding definitions of MarshalingPInvokeScannerPath to more locations.
    
    * Adding missing references to PInvoke scanner.
    
    * Changed task ordering, assemblies list.
    
    * Removed metadata load context.
    
    * Fixed code analyzer issues.
    
    * Fixed file name.
    
    * Moved MarshalingPInvokeScanner to MonoTargetsTask.
    
    * Removed BlazorApp.
    
    * Implemented more marshaling validation rules, removed warning message that got "promoted" to an error.
    
    * Catching bad image exceptions, giving reason for requiring marshal-ilgen.
    
    * Cleaned up references to standalone MarshalingPInvokeScanner project, now that the analyzer is in MonoTargtesTask.
    
    * More cleanup.
    
    * Fixed P/Invoke return value in marshal-lightweight.
    
    * Removed incompatible assemblies listing.
    
    * Restoring minimal functionality to marshal-ilgen-stub.
    
    * Addressed feedback.
    
    * Tweaked identification of blittable types. Added explanation to Compatibility enum.
    
    * Moved PInvokeCollector.cs and SignatureMapper.cs back to WasmAppBuilder.
