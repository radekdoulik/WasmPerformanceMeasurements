    Fix detection of exceptionally called funclet in stack walk (#99958)
    
    There is a problem with stack walking detecting funclets called during
    exception handling with the new EH enabled. The code was considering any
    funclet it found below the topmost ExInfo, but I have not realized it
    can also hit non-exceptionally called finallys. Those don't have any
    exception handling going on and thus are incorrectly used for storing
    information that it used later at the parent to track GC references.
    We need to consider only funclets that were called exceptionally.
