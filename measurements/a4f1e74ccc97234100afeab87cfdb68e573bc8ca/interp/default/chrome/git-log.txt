    Preserve all InternalsVisibleTo attributes in ILLink Trimmer (#98910)
    
    Removes previous special handling to only keep IVT attributes for
    assemblies that were resolvable and marked at link time. This behaviour
    could cause a noticeable difference in behaviour at runtime without emitting
    any trim analysis warnings while providing no mechanism to retain the
    attributes. The removal of these attributes provides only a neglible
    size reduction.
    
    Fixes #92582
