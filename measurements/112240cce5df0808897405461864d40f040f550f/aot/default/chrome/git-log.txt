    Fix extra stack frame on exception stack trace (#99263)
    
    A recently added diagnostic test has revealed that throwing an exception
    from a funclet results in an extra frame on the stack trace that should
    not be there.
    This change fixes it in a manner equivalent to how the old EH handles that.
