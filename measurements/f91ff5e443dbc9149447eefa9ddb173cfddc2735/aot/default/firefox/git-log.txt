    Change empty subject test certificate to include a critical SAN.
    
    This test was marked SkipOnPlatform for Android because the test would fail. However,
    it turns out that Android does support empty subjects in certificates. If the subject
    is empty, then the SubjectAltName extension must be marked critical. This is in accordance
    with RFC 5280:
    
    > If the subject field contains an empty sequence, then the issuing CA MUST include a subjectAltName extension that is marked as critical.
    
    With a critical SAN extension, this test now passes on all platforms.
