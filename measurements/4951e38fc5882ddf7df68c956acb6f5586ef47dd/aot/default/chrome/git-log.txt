    More WriteGather fixes (#109826)
    
    * don't run these tests in parallel, as each test cases uses more than 4 GB ram and disk!
    
    * fix the test: handle incomplete reads that should happen when we hit the max buffer limit
    
    * incomplete write fix:
    
    - pin the buffers only once
    - when re-trying, do that only for the actual reminder
    
    * Use native memory to get OOM a soon as we run out of memory (hoping to avoid the process getting killed on Linux when OOM happens)
    
    * For macOS preadv and pwritev can fail with EINVAL when the total length of all vectors overflows a 32-bit integer.
    
    * add an assert that is going to warn us if vector.Count is ever more than Int32.MaxValue
