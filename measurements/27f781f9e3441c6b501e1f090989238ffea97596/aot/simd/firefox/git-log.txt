    Adds a test for compiler generated trim warning suppression issue (#82957)
    
    This is adding a test for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/82956 (currently assumes the wrong behavior).
    
    Also adds a solution file which includes all three trim tools, illink, illink.analyzer and ilc. This brings several advantages:
    - As we share more source files between the tools it will be much easier to work in.
    - We already share test sources, so this makes it easy to run the modified test with all three tools at once (from one instance of VS)
