    Add RuntimeInformation.FrameworkDescription test to validate version (#93913)
    
    We need to make sure the string contains only the stabilized version in servicing, or a non-stabilized one otherwise. This prevents issues like https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/45812 and what we hit in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/93807.
    
    Closes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/45812
