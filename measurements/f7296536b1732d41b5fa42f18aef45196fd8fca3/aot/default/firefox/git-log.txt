    JIT: update block weight for uncond to cond flow opt (#98324)
    
    This optimization duplicates code and flow in a BBJ_COND successor into one of its
    preds; as a result the weight of the successor should decrease.
    
    Fixes some issues seen with odd perf scores in the ML/CSE experiment.
    
    Contributes to #93020
