    Improve BasicBlock dumping (#97362)
    
    * Improve BasicBlock dumping in the block table
    
    1. Display both true and false target destinations of blocks
    2. If you set `DOTNET_JitDumpTerseNextBlock=1`, if a branch goes to the next block that will be displayed
    in the table, display "*" instead of the block number, as a shorthand to reduce visual clutter.
    3. Allow block dump to work with null (uninitialized) block targets.
