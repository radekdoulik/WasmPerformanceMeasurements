    Disable GC stress tests for the interpreter test (#112906)
    
    * Disable GC stress tests for the interpreter test
    
    There is a problem with the interpreter codegen and GC stress. The
    runtime is attempting to sprinkle breakpoints in the interpreter IR.
    
    Temporarily disable the GC stress for the test until it is fixed.
    
    * Update src/tests/JIT/interpreter/InterpreterTester.csproj
