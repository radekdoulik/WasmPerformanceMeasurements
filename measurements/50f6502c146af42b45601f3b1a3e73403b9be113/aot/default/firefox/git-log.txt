    [wasm] Fix perf pipeline runs (#93688)
    
    * [wasm] perf: Copy targeting pack nuget also for perf pipeline
    
    * [wasm] perf: remove workaround added for 8.0 to 9.0 transition
    
    * Use built-nugets as an additional nuget source, for microbenchmarks
    
    * perf CI: run only a few benchmarks when running for sanity check
