    Update JIT debug helpers (#93086)
    
    * Update JIT debug helpers
    
    1. Make them available in builds linked using /OPT:REF (currently,
    Checked builds (on Windows); they are not available at all in Release builds).
    2. Add a bunch of missing documentation.
    3. Add `cTreeRange`
    4. Make the newer dumpers more consistent with the rest by dumping a sequence number.
    5. Add `dbLoop` for `dFindLoop`
    
    * Support x86, arm64
