    Expose ChannelReader.ReadAllAsync from non-core builds as well (#94417)
    
    * Expose ChannelReader.ReadAllAsync from non-core builds as well
    
    I'm not sure why we didn't fix this before when we shipped Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces, but with IAsyncEnumerable available downlevel, there's no need to hide this method away; it can be in all builds.  Doing so makes it easier for others to create their own channel implementations, as they don't _need_ to multitarget in order to override everything they might want to.
    
    I've not changed any C# code, just moved it between files.
    
    * Address PR feedback
