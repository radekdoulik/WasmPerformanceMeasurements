    Make it possible to remove DotNetRuntimeDebugHeader (#91775)
    
    There's popular demand to be able to remove this export, see these in the past: #79197, dotnet/runtimelab#739
    
    Fixes #90838 by lumping it together with `DebuggerSupport`. It feels like the most natural switch. I didn't go as far as completely removing the data structures because the savings would likely be miniscule (4 kB contribution from the object file per SizeBench).
