    JIT: enable devirtualization/inlining of other array interface methods (#109209)
    
    The JIT recently enabled devirtualization of `GetEnumerator`, but for some cases
    were inhibited from devirtualization because the runtime was returning an
    instantiating stub instead of the actual method. This blocked inlining and
    the JIT currently will not GDV unless it can also inline.
    
    So for instance `ICollection<T>.Count` would not devirtualize.
    
    We think we know enough to pass the right inst parameter (the exact method
    desc) so enable this for the array case, at least for normal jitting.
    
    For NAOT array devirtualization happens via normal paths thanks to `Array<T>` so
    should already fpr these cases. For R2R we don't do array interface devirt (yet).
    
    There was an existing field on `CORINFO_DEVIRTUALIZATION_INFO` to record the
    need for an inst parameter, but it was unused and so I renamed it and use it
    for this case.
    
    Contributes to #108913.
