    Remove 'tracing' from Native AOT PR runs (#92825)
    
    Tracing heavily increases the time it takes to run Native AOT tests.
    We already run these tests in the outerloop and the probability that
    any given PR will break these tests is low. Outerloop coverage should
    be good enough right now.
