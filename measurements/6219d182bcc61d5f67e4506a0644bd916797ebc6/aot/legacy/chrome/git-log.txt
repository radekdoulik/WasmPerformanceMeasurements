    Fix SSP issue with HW exceptions from JIT helpers (#107665)
    
    The recent change that was fixing bad SSP updating during exception
    handling with funceval has also modified the way SSP is extracted for
    hardware exceptions. That works fine for many cases, but there is a
    problem when the exception occurs in a JIT helper. The
    `AjustContextForJITHelpers` uses only the basic `CONTEXT` structure for
    unwinding to the managed caller and so the SSP is not properly updated.
    That makes it off by one slot when we set it when continuing execution
    after catch.
    This change removes storing SSP for hardware exceptions in the
    FaultingExceptionFrame to mitigate the issue. It effectively returns to
    the way software exceptions use - scanning shadow stack for the
    instruction pointer of the frame to which it is going to resume after
    catch.
