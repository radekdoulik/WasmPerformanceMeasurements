    JIT: Fix SysV first/second return register GC info mismatch when generating calls (#115827)
    
    On SysV it is possible to have mixed SIMD/integer return registers for
    calls. This leads to a case where the first return register is a SIMD
    register, while the second return register is an integer register. In
    that particular case, the emitter would get confused and expect GC
    information for the second return register to refer to `rdx`, when in
    reality it refers to `rax`.
    
    Fix the problem by detecting the case where the second register is
    `rax`, and communicating the right information back to the emitter. Also
    add a test case that reliably segfaults under `DOTNET_GCStress=C`
    without the fix.
