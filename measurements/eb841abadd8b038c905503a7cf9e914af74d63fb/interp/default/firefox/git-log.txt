    [RISC-V] Improve code generating resolve stub assembly (#102318)
    
    * [RISC-V] Improve code generating resolve stub assembly
    
    This change replaces magic numbers with proper offsetofs and use compile time asserts instead runtime ones.
    That should make developers life easier in case of debugging or changing resolve stubs assembly.
    
    * Move annotation and don't check same thing many times
