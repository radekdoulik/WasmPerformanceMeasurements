    JIT: Switch config values to UTF8 (#109418)
    
    - Switch JitConfig strings from UTF16 to UTF8
    - Switch relevant JIT-EE and host methods to UTF8
    - Remove `getJitTimeLogFilename` JIT-EE call, which seemingly existed to avoid
      having a config parser in the JIT in release builds, but that ship has sailed
