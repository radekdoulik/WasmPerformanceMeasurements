    * Use DotNetBuildOrchestrator to avoid executing in a repo source-build context.
    
    * Actually, we want this logic to run only when we're running in a non-VMR-like context, even repo build.
    
    * Restore, but only restore the toolset in the publish job
    
    * Fix Exists check and do the "restore toolset only" check one degree away from the Arcade SDK.
    
    * Set the "publish using pipelines" global property when publishing
    
    * Don't produce the product version files on repo source build.
