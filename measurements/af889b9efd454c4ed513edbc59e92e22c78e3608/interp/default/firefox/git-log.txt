    JIT: synthesize PGO if no schema, when dynamic PGO is active (#101739)
    
    If we know dynamic PGO is active, and we do not find a PGO schema for a method,
    synthesize PGO data. The schema may be missing if the method was prejitted but
    not covered by static PGO, or was considered too simple to need profiling (aka
    minimal profiling).
    
    This synthesis removes the possibility of a mixed PGO/no PGO situation. These
    are problematic, especially in methods that do a lot of inlining. Now when
    dynamic PGO is active all methods that get optimized will have some form of
    PGO data.
    
    Only run profile incorporation when optimizing. Reset BBOPT/pgo vars if we
    switch away from optimization or have a min opts failover.
    
    Contributes to #93020.
