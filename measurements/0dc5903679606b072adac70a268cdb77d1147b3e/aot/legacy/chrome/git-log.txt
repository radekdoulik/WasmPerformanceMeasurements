    Fix trimming of DebuggerDisplay with Name (#92191)
    
    The `Name` and `Type` property of the `DebuggerDisplay` attribute accepts the
    same format string as its `Value` property, but does not prevent
    trimming members it references. Thanks to this fix, members referenced by
    any of these two properties are not trimmed and can be displayed by a
    debugger.
