    Add references to xunit.*.dll to CLRTest.Crossgen.targets (#83413)
    
    This change fixes the exceptions thrown from Crossgen2 JIT
    interface when JIT tries to resolve tokens from xunit.assert.
    As a secondary effect the frequent exception throws triggered
    the race condition
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/81884
    
    triggering non-deterministic native CoreCLR runtime failures on
    arm64. I was originally reluctant to fix this primary issue until
    the native runtime bug is understood as otherwise this fix would
    just cause the issue to stop manifesting without being actually
    fixed. As the runtime bug has been fixed by now, I am fixing
    Crossgen2 executions to stop hitting these resolution exceptions.
    
    Thanks
    
    Tomas
