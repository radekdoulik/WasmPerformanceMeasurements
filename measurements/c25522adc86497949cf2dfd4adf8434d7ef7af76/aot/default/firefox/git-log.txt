    [mono][interp] Fix arg alignment issues when mixing with compiled code (#85153)
    
    * [mono][interp] Refactor arg offset computation to make code clearer
    
    * [mono][interp] Remove redundant assign
    
    * [mono][interp] Move mint_type out from header file
    
    It makes no sense to inline this big method into callers.
    
    * [mono][interp] Fix arg offset computation when doing pinvoke and aot/jit calls from interp
    
    The previous code wasn't handling alignment of simd types.
    
    * [mono][interp] Use the correct alignment for args when entering interp
    
    We stop computing the arguments on the fly since it's getting too expensive doing the alignment checks. We directly use `imethod->arg_offsets` instead which is computed once during the first call, while also ensuring consistency with the calculation.
    
    * [mono][interp] Fix arg offset computation when running clauses with interp
    
    * [mono][interp] Remove dead code
    
    * Temporaril disable jiterp for CI
    
    * Update jiterpreter interp_entry wrapper generator and re-enable jiterp
    
    * Revert options-def.h changes
