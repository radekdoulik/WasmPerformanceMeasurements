    JIT: Fix last block removal during layout optimization (#96649)
    
    Fixes #96642, though the issue doesn't seem limited to hot/cold splitting scenarios. In Compiler::fgOptimizeEmptyBlock, if removing the last block, we previously updated fgLastBB to point to its previous block before calling Compiler::fgRemoveBlock to avoid triggering an overzealous assert. By updating fgLastBB prematurely, we'd execute the wrong path for updating the removed block's next/previous pointers in Compiler::fgUnlinkBlock, hence the next != nullptr assert in BasicBlock::SetNext. This change updates fgOptimizeEmptyBlock to not prematurely update fgLastBB, instead allowing fgUnlinkBlock to update fgLastBB if unlinking the last block; to make this work, it also removes the overzealous assert in fgRemoveBlock.
