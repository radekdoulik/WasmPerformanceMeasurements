    Check Locations length before accessing (#87659)
    
    Fixes an `IndexOutOfRangeException` thrown by the analyzer when
    analyzing method parameters for the implicitly generated Main
    method when using top-level statements. These method parameters
    don't have location info because they are not in user code.
    
    This also adds checks in the other places this analyzer accesses
    `Locations[0]`, to be safe.
