    Factor positive lookaheads better into find optimizations (#112107)
    
    * Factor positive lookaheads better into find optimizations
    
    A positive lookahead at the start of a pattern can be used for determining find optimizations even when the non-zero-width portions of the pattern aren't. This helps particularly in cases where the positive lookahead contains an anchor or a literal.
    
    Also extends the existing alternation reduction optimization to factor out anchors that begin every branch of an alternation.
