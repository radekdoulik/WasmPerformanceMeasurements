    JIT: Always create `FIELD_LIST` for struct args in physical promotion (#118778)
    
    Today physical promotion will create `FIELD_LIST` for returned struct values. However, arguments did not get the same treatment and had constraints motivated by old limitations of the backend. Since those limitations are gone now we can just indiscriminately produce `FIELD_LIST` in physical promotion.
