    JIT: Add a uniform mechanism to track metadata/metrics about the compilation (#98653)
    
    Adds a JIT-EE API to report metadata back to the EE side about the JIT
    compilation, and adds support for saving these metrics as part of SPMI runs.
    Switches a number of adhoc metrics to use this scheme, and also adds a few new
    ones.
    
    The metadata is currently only reported with checked JITs.
    
    Also adds support for fast perfscore diffs, and adds perfscore into the reports
    generated by `superpmi.py asmdiffs`.
    
    Fix #52877
