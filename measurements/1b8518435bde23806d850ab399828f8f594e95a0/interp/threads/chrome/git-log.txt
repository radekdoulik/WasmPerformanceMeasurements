    Enlarge stack overflow handling helper stack (#110068)
    
    The stack overflow coreclr tests started to fail recently. It turns out that
    was caused by the size of the helper stack allocated for stack overflow
    handling case is no longer sufficient. Moreover, there is a bug in
    `Thread::CreateUtilityThread` that calls the `SetThreadName` even when the
    thread creation fails.
    
    Close #109499
