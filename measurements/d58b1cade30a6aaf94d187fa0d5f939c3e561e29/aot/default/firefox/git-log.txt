    Fix perf problems found in investigation of issue #107728 (#107806)
    
    - `CheckRunClassInitThrowing` didn't check to see if the class had been initialized before taking a lock
    - `EnsureTlsIndexAllocated` didn't check if the Tls index had been allocated before setting the flag via an expensive Interlocked call to indicate that it had been allocated
    - And finally `JIT_GetNonGCThreadStaticBaseOptimized` and `JIT_GetGCThreadStaticBaseOptimized` were missing the fast paths which avoided even calling those apis at all.
    
    Perf with a small benchmark which does complex multithreaded work...
