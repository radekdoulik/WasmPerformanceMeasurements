    [ci] Fix Playwright test times out/fails because target closed (#100074)
    
    * Fix: `OnPageLoaded` did not guarantee WASM got already loaded.
    
    * Trigger the test only on first render, otherwise it would be triggered multiple times.
    
    * Add logs to see why the test timed out.
    
    * Even more logging.
    
    * Most logging won't be useful - remove.
    
    * Prevent no logs when error thrown in the app.
    
    * Cleanup.
    
    * typo
    
    * @maraf's feedback - make waiting deterministic
