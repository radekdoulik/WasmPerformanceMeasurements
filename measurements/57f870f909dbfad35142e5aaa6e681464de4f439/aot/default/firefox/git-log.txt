    JIT: Improve strength reduction's prediction of loop reversal (#104800)
    
    The current goal is to make sure strength reduction does not introduce new
    primary IVs. To do so we rely on the downwards-loop transformation to get rid of
    uses of the primary IV in the loop test.
    This PR refines the checks that strength reduction was using to predict whether
    a use of the primary IV in a loop test will be removed. It should now be the
    exact same checks as the downwards-transformation uses.
    
    Additionally, it means we can remove `CursorInfo::IsInsideExitTest`; we now just
    avoid creating the cursor in the first place if we know the use will be
    removable.
