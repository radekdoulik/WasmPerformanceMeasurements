    Tar: fix handing of null terminated fields. (#117410)
    
    * Tar: fix handing of null terminated fields.
    
    The current implementation is trimming spaces and nulls from the end.
    
    Instead we need to find the terminating null from the start,
    and we shouldn't trim spaces at the end.
    
    * Fix not advancing over datastream with length 1, which caused the DataOffset_RegularFile_SecondEntry test to fail.
    
    * Skip test cases that depend on checksum being checked.
    
    * Simplify LimitByRemaining.
    
    * Add test.
    
    * Refactor SetReachedEnd.
    
    * Throw InvalidDataException when the extended header contains invalid records.
