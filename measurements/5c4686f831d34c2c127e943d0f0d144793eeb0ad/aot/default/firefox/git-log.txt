    [wasm] Implement MINT_SWITCH opcode in jiterpreter (#107423)
    
    * Implement MINT_SWITCH opcode (without support for backward jumps)
    * Introduce runtime option for max switch size (set to 0 to disable switches)
    * Disable trace generation once the trace table fills up, since there's no point to it
