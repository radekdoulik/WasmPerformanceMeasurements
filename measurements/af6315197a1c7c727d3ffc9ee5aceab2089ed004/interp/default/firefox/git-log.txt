    JIT: Switch `StaysWithinManagedObject` to peel offsets from VNs (#105169)
    
    The SCEV analysis does not care about the value of something once it is
    seen to be invariant inside the loop we are currently analyzing. This
    was problematic for this logic that tries to peel additions away from
    offsets; for arm64, we may have hoisted `array + 0x10` outside the loop,
    which would cause us to fail to get back to the base array.
    
    Switch the reasoning to use VNs and peel the offsets from the VNs
    instead.
    
    No x64 diffs are expected as we do not hoist the `array + 0x10` out of
    the loop there. Improvements expected on arm64 where we can now prove
    that a "full" strength reduction is allowable more often.
