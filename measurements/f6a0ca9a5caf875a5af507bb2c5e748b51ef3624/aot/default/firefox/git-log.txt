    In Windows host, use WriteConsoleW for stdout and stderr, and locale enabled print for file output (#102295)
    
    Uses WriteConsoleW for writing to stdout and std err, and uses the locale version of vfwprintf to print to a file using the utf8 locale. This properly renders utf8 and GB18030 characters in the host output.
