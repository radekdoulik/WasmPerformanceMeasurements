    Fix build with FEATURE_STANDALONE_GC disabled (#111682)
    
    * Fix build with FEATURE_STANDALONE_GC disabled
    
    Currently, the build fails, because the gc_pal is built only when
    standalone GC is enabled, but it is used for the built-in GC as
    well.
    
    This change fixes it.
