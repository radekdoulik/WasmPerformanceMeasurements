    [hot_reload] Remove pass1 (#95130)
    
    * [hot_reload] Remove pass1
    
    The job of pass1 was to validate that the EnC delta had the expected
    structure.
    This was particularly useful before Roslyn added the capabilities API
    and it could potentially send us changes that we weren't able to
    handle yet.
    In some cases we were actually too strict and disallowed benign
    edits (that sometimes happen because it is easier for roslyn to send
    an update that has no effect than to compute how to leave it out).
    But now Mono is in lock-step with all supported edits, so pass1 is not
    necessary.  Pass2 still has some structural checks to validate some of our
    assumptions, but we don't expect them to be violated in any supported edits.
    
    Fixes #90153
