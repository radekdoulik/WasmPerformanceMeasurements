    Move ComWrappers AddRef to C/C++ (#110762)
    
    * Move ComWrappers AddRef to C/C++
    
    Xaml invokes AddRef while holding a lock that it *also* holds while a GC is in progress. Managed AddRef had to synchronize with the GC that caused intermittent deadlocks with the other thread holding Xaml's lock.
    
    This change reverts the managed AddRef implementation to match .NET Native and CoreCLR.
    
    Fixes #110747
