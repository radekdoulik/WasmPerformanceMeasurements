    Disable S.T.Json tests on NativeAOT (#87203)
    
    We're getting OOM-killed in the CI. See #87078.
    
    I'm also changing how we do warning suppressions. We still need to suppress most of AOT warnings because xUnit/tests are not warning clean, but the warning about generic recursion is critical for the product and should fail the build.
