    JIT: add ability to pad profile counters and adjust scalable count thâ€¦ (#91081)
    
    * `DOTNET_JitCounterPadding`: adds the ability to pad profile counters by some
    number of counter-sized slots, to mitigate the effects of false sharing. For
    example with 64 bit counters, setting `DOTNET_JitCounterPadding=8` means each
    counter is now on its own cache line (for xarch).
    
    * `DOTNET_TieredPGO_ScalableCountThreshold`: adds the ability to alter the scalable
    profile counter's threshold for switching to approximate counting. Defaults to 13
    which means profile counts are exact up to 2^13 = 8192 and approximate above that.
    Lower values will reduce the volume of counter updates (also mitigating false sharing
    impact) but make the counts more approximate.
