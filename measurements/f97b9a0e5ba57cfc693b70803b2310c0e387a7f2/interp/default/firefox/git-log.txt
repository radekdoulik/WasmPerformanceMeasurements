    JIT: Relax assertion for handlers of unreachable try clauses (#111652)
    
    For unreachable try clauses it is possible to still see spurious flow
    into their handlers because of second pass EH. We can then end up with a
    case where a handler is dominated by one of its enclosed blocks. For
    definitions in that enclosed block we thus won't find any phi in the
    enclosing handler; tolerate this case.
    
    Fix #111341
