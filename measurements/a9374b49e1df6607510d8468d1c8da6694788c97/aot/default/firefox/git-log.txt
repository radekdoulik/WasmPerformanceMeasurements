    Fix GC hole with `rorx` instruction (#114467)
    
    The `rorx` instruction uses format IF_RWR_ARD_CNS. This format was not
    handled when killing GC refs in `emitOutputAM`.
    
    I added other cases of register write "ARD" address mode formats
    to the same case as "defense in depth" -- most or all of them are
    probably SIMD instructions with SIMD destination registers, and won't go
    down this code path.
    
    Diffs include cases in the HardwareIntrinsics tests, but also in the
    libraries code, for both x64 and x86.
