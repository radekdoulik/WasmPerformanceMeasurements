    Do not look at unboxing bit when looking up constructed generic methods (#118211)
    
    Fixes #118072.
    
    In the bug we were ending up in a situation where we remember generic dictionary for a `MethodDesc` with `UnboxingStub` bit set to true and then try to look up a generic dictionary for a `MethodDesc` with unboxing stub bit set to false (the false is hardcoded in the code I'm updating).
    
    This is all sorts of wrong. The unboxing MethodDescs in the runtime type system were a mistake. We get by without them in the compiler.
    
    This is really difficult to hit because the runtime type system is mutable (this is yet another mistake) and if we still have a cached version of this mutable type system around, this lookup is not used.
    
    The regression test I added is really annoying and takes like 40 seconds to run in checked builds. I hate it, but this is not hittable in any other way. I'm not sure if this one is 100% reliable at triggering the type system flush either.
