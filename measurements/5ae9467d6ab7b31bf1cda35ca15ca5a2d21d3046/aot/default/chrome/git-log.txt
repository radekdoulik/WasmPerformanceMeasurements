    JIT: add more "simple" complexity helpers (#110486)
    
    In early phases we haven't set tree costs or size estimates, so we fall back
    to counting statements or nodes.
    
    Capture some of this in some helper methods, both pure counting and "exceeds"
    variants (which are potentially cheaper when comparing against a budget).
    
    Update the loop cloning size check to use this.
