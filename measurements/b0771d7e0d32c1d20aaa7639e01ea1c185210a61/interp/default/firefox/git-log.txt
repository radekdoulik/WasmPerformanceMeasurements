    Fix getting SSP for threadabort in funceval (#107320)
    
    * Fix getting SSP for threadabort in funceval
    
    Diagnostics test that test threadabort during funceval crashes on
    machines with CET enabled. The reason is that when a thread is
    redirected to the RedirectForThrowControl, the original instruction
    address from which we've redirected is not on the shadow stack.
    That causes the exception handling propagating the related
    thread abort to fail finding that instruction address on the shadow
    stack. It walks out of its range and then crashes with access
    violation.
    
    This change fixes it by storing the SSP in the FaultingExceptionFrame
    and copying it to the REGDISPLAY when UpdateRegDisplay is called on
    that frame. That way the correct SSP is already known in the SfiInit and
    we don't need to look it up.
    
    * Clear rax before rdsspq for proper behavior on non-cet devices
