    Clean up and consolidate HostModel tests. (#97244)
    
    - Merge HostModel AppHost/Bundle/ComHost tests into one `Microsoft.NET.HostModel.Tests` project
      - Move symbolic link tests into `HostActivation.Tests` - they are not testing HostModel
      - Rename `AppHostUpdateTests` to `CreateAppHost` - that is the API they are testing
    - Switch `AppWithUnknownLanguageResource` to pre-built asset
      - Move to `CreateAppHost` test class
