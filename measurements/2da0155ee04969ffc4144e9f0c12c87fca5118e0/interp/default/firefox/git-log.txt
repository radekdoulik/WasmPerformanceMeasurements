    Reuse characteristic mechanism for IDynIntfCastable trimming (#118884)
    
    Implements suggestion from https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/118769#issuecomment-3192084645.
    
    We could probably replace `CanHaveDynamicInterfaceImplementations` with this too, but we'd need to make it so that characteristics are available in `Compilation` class. They are currently hidden in `SubstitutionILProvider`.
