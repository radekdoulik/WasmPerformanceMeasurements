    SPMI: Run 64-bit diffs on OSX.14.Arm64.Open (#116299)
    
    This should make the 64-bit diffs quite a bit faster because:
    1. The existing Windows queues are Azure managed, so they often need to
       scale up as part of running Helix work items, which adds time
    2. The OSX queues are on-prem queues and always have machines ready to
       accept work. Additionally each machine is very powerful.
