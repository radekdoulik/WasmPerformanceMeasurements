    Ensure Array.CreateInstance over reference types works (#100626)
    
    We have warning suppressions in place assuming `Array.CreateInstance` will succeed if it's over reference types, same as `MakeGeneric`. There's however no analysis to ensure we have the type loader template for `__Canon[]`. This adds the analysis.
    
    The `reflection\GenericAttribute` test is currently failing because of this but we don't see it because it's marked RequiresProcessIsolation and we have a bug that we don't look at those tests at all.
    
    We had this bug for a while, but the test regression is more recent because we're getting better at not generating useless stuff. Template for `__Canon[]` is probably part of any bigger test because it's common.
