    Fix declaration of DiagAddNewRegion (#94759)
    
    `uint8_t` is the type that is used thorough the codebase here. `BYTE` happens to not be defined for some build configurations and produces a build break. I'm also removing the space because the prevailing code style in this file is no space between type and asterisk.
