    [vm] fix confusing use of m_pCanonMT (NFC) (#102936)
    
    `m_pCanonMT` and `m_pEEClass` are union members so they're the same
    value where the lowest bit is used as a flag to indicate which one you
    have.  In a canonical method table, you always have `m_pEEClass`.
    `m_pEEClass` has the lowest bit cleared.  So to get the actual
    pointer, just return it.
    
    This just cleans up hard to read code, there is no functional change
    at runtime.
