    Convert asserts in CEEInfo::getStaticFieldContent() to 'if' checks (#100320)
    
    * Add additional checks to optimization of constant static field loads
    
    In `fgGetStaticFieldSeqAndAddress`, if we have a static field address
    altered by a tree of `ADD CNS_INS` nodes, we need to verify that the
    address is within the found field sequence. It might not be after
    shared constant CSE kicks in (e.g., under OptRepeat), where the
    sequence of ADDs might be the alter an arbitrary constant address from
    one type into the address of the static field of a different type.
    So we can't use the FieldSeq of the base address when considering
    the full offset.
    
    * Review feedback
    
    1. Use `eeGetFieldName` / `eeGetClassName` return pointer
    2. Only query extra metadata under `verbose || JitConfig.EnableExtraSuperPmiQueries()`
