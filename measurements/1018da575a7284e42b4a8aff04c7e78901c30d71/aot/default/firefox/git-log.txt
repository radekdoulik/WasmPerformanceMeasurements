    Recover some lost EH performance on Unix amd64 (#90033)
    
    * Improve EH performance on Unix amd64
    
    Few months ago, a change to enable AVX512 on Unix was merged in.
    That change has enlarged the CONTEXT structure significantly and
    it was found that it has caused 6..17% regressions in exception handling
    microbenchmarks.
    
    This change gets some of the lost performance back by adding custom
    copy constructor and assignment operator to the CONTEXT structure
    and preventing copying of the AVX / AVX512 stuff if the source
    context doesn't have it. I have observed 3..9% gain on my machine.
    
    Close #84308
    
    * Fix gcc build and size for non-xstate case
    
    * Fix yet another gcc break
    
    * Fix build break
    
    * Revert the gcc fixes and disable the warning
    
    The zeroing of CONTEXT structure is used at too many places and
    it is valid, so rather than trying to modify all the places by
    using placement new, just disable the warning for gcc.
