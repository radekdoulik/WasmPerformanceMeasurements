    [NativeAOT] Delegate bug fixes (#99185)
    
    - Fix Delegate.Method and Delegate.Target for marshalled delegates
    - Add tests and fixes for various delegate corner case behaviors
    - Delete runtime test for GetInvocationList since there is a better test coverage for this API under libraries
    - Delete `m` prefix on System.Delegate member fields
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/164
