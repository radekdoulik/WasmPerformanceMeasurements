    Fix WebSockets.Client.ConnectTest crash for apple mobile platforms (#75344)
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/74473 had a change where we started adding a client certificate that is not supported on apple mobile platforms. This lead to an unhandled exception in the MemberData setup of ConnectAsync_CustomInvokerWithIncompatibleWebSocketOptions_ThrowsArgumentException and resulted in an app crash.
    
    Addresses https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/75307
