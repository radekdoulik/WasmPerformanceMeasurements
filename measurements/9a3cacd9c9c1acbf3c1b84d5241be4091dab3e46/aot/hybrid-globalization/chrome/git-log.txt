    Move PendingTypeLoadTable from the ClassLoader object to a global structure (#96653)
    
    - Shard the hashtable so that it will rarely have lock contention
    - Pre-allocate the PendingTypeLoad Entries. This reduces allocator pressure on startup substantially, especially in the presence of multithreaded loading where the struct is allocated on 1 thread and often freed on another.
    
    The effectiveness of the pre-allocation and sharding heuristics was measured on a complex ASP.NET scenario tweaked to perform extremely high numbers of multithreaded loads and produced startup wins of about 10%.
