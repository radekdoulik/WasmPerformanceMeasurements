    JIT: Refactor physical promotion in preparation of generalized assignment decomposition (#85728)
    
    This refactors the physical promotion to make the generalized assignment
    decomposition PR more manageable to review.
    
    * Pull Replacement and ReplaceVisitor into the header
    * Introduce promotiondecomposition.cpp that deals with handling
      assignments, and move relevant code from promotion.cpp to this file
    * Rename StatementList -> DecompositionStatementList and unnest it
    * Rename Replacement::Name -> Replacement::Description which is more fitting
    
    Also adds some more JITDUMPs when picking promotions, but otherwise
    should not affect behavior.
