    Fix function pointer as fields inspection (#83981)
    
    This was missed when C# function pointers support
    was added to the runtime. The current fix is reporting
    all functions pointers as `IntPtr` type. It should be
    possible in a future update to properly represent a
    more accurate type for the function pointer.
