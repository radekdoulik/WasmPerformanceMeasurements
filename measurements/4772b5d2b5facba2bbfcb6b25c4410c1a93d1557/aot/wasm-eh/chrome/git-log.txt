    ComWrappers test that allocate object can't inline (#85583)
    
    * ComWrappers test that allocate object can't inline
    
    There are some JIT stress settings that aggressively
    inline functions, regardless of size/complexity. This
    inlining can perturb the subtle GC assumptions
    inherent in the COM wrappers tests.
