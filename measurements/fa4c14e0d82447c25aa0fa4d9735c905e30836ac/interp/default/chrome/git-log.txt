    Reapply "Refactor `external_assembly_probe` to be separate from single-file bundle probing" (#113776)
    
    Undo the revert in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/113738
    
    Fix on top of the original: Make a copy of the host contract information on initialization instead of just operating on a pointer to the struct. This should address intermittent failures on shutdown where a thread is still running after coreclr_shutdown has completed and the actual contract struct provided by a host may be cleaned up. The assumption is that any function pointers provided on the host contract at initialization should remain valid for the process lifetime.
