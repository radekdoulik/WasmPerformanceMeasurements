    Downgrade STJ to 8.0.4 (#109818)
    
    * Downgrade STJ to 8.0.4
    
    We can't yet rely on a STJ/8.0.5 package as desktop msbuild doesn't have binding redirects for it yet.
    
    - Suppress the src/tasks vulnerability warning as STJ isn't used at runtime for msbuild tasks.
    - Suppress the ones about HostModel's usage. We want to use a live STJ instead but that needs a separate PR (more work).
    
    * Update STJ and add temporary suppressions
