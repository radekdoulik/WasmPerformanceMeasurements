    Workaround MSVC miscompiling sgen_clz (#114786)
    
    After the recent VS upgrade from 17.12.5 to 17.13.2 we started seeing access violations in the mono-aot-cross.exe when targetting wasm.
    
    We tracked it down to sgen_clz being miscompiled, we can workaround the compiler bug by switching from ternary condition to if/else.
