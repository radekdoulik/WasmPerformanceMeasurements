    JIT: Port loop compaction to new loop representation (#96995)
    
    Some diffs expected from (at least) three sources:
    - Less/different compaction in cases where new loop recognition
      recognizes fewer loops than old recognition
    - Less compaction in cases where compacting the first loop led to
      old loop recognition recognizing another loop after the first one.
      This leads to no `BBF_OLD_LOOP_HEADER_QUIRK` set on the second loop's
      header found by new loop finding, meaning we do not compact it. It
      will be compacted as part of a future PR that enables compaction for
      all loops.
    - Slight differences in compaction behavior for blocks that aren't part
      of the loop and that couldn't be moved, which would previously abort
      compaction and recognition of the loop. Now we just leave those blocks
      in place.
