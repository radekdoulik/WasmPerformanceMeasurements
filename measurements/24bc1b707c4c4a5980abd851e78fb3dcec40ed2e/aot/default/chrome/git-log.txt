    JIT: Remove `BBJ_RETURN` loop cloning quirk (#96555)
    
    With the new loop representation there will never be any `BBJ_RETURN`
    blocks in loops we are cloning -- add an assert for this. Then remove
    the quirk that avoids cloning loops when the old loop cloning would
    create too many `BBJ_RETURN` blocks.
    
    Large size wise regressions are expected due to new cloning.
