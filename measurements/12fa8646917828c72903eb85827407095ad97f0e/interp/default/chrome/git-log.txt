    Fix exception handling in the prestub worker (#111937)
    
    * Fix exception handling in prestub worker
    
    There is a bug in the new exception handling when ThePreStub is called
    from CallDescrWorkerInternal and the exception is propagated through
    that. One of such cases is when a managed class is being initialized
    during JITting and the constructor is in an assembly that's not found.
    The bug results in skipping all the native frames upto a managed frame
    that called that native chain that lead to the exception. In the
    specific case I've mentioned, a lock in the native code is left in
    locked state. That later leads to a hang. This was case was observed
    with Roslyn invoking an analyzer where one of the dependencies was
    missing.
    
    The fix is to ensure that when ThePreStub is called by
    CallDescrWorkerInternal, the exception is not caught in the
    PreStubWorker. It is left flowing into the native calling code instead.
    
    On Windows, we also need to prevent the ProcessCLRException invocation
    to call into the managed exception handling code.
    
    * Regression test
    
    * Fix ExternalMethodFixupWorker and VSD_ResolveWorker too
    
    These two need the same treatment when they end up being called from
    CallDescrWorkerInternal.
    
    Add regression tests for those cases too. These two cases don't result
    in a visible failure, so the regression tests just exercise the specific
    code paths.
    
    * Disable the regression test for NativeAOT / MonoAOT
    
    * Reverting change in PrestubWorker_Preemptive
    
    This change is not needed, as that function cannot be called via
    CallDescrWorker.
    
    * Few forgotten cleanups
    
    * Remove the RequiresProcessIsolation
    
    * Disable the regression test for WASM
    
    * Attempt to properly disable the test for WASM
    
    * Another attempt to prevent running the test on WASM
