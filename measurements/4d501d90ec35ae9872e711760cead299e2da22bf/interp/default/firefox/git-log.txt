    BinaryFormatter tests should be skipped only on AOT, WASM and Mobile (#106858)
    
    * respect AppContext switch (which is currently enabled for all projects in the root Directory.Build.props file)
    
    * add project reference to all test projects that need working BF (and were being skipped for a while)
    
    * adjust to changes from #104202: EqualityComparer<string>.Default is mapped to StringEqualityComparer, but serialized as GenericEqualityComparer<string>
