    Fix JitOptRepeat (#94250)
    
    1. Remove an assertion checking assert that can be invalid under JitOptRepeat, where we might
    lose information that a constant was ever a handle.
    2. Disable JIT/Directed/debugging/debuginfo/tester.csproj under OptRepeat: optimizations
    mess with its debug info expectations.
    3. Enable JitOptRepeat under stress
