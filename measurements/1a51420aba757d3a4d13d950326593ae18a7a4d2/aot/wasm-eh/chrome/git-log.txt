    JIT: properly scrub SSA from return address buffers (#85746)
    
    These can be in SSA and were not getting their SSA numbers cleaned by
    `fgResetForSsa`, so in repeat mode they might trigger SSA check failures.
    
    Also changed it so you can dump the SSA number without triggering an
    assert.
    
    Fixes #85629
