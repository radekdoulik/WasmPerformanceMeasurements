    [mono][interp] Small code refactoring for SSA (#97249)
    
    * [mono][interp] Move optimization related code out of transform.c
    
    Use interp_ prefix for non-static methods within interpreter (mono_interp seems rather long)
    Use interp_ prefix, instead of .._interp_..., for consistency.
    Use ins everywhere in method names for consistency, instead of inst.
    
    * [mono][interp] Pass ref to var storage in interp inst
    
    In order to facilitate overwritting of sregs/dreg during instruction iterations.
    
    Also enable iterating only on sregs.
    
    * [mono][interp] Print invalid il offset in aligned fashion
    
    * [mono][interp] Remove irrelevant stats
    
    * [mono][interp] Renaming of local to var
    
    Local can have multiple meanings. Use it to refer to IL locals from now. All IL locals are vars. Vars can be local (single bblock use) or global.
    
    * [mono][interp] Remove flags and use bit fields instead
    
    Makes the code clearer and it is easier to maintain.
