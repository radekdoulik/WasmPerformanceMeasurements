    Migrate to zlib-ng, part 1: copy source code only (#102520)
    
    * Bring in the zlib-ng source code into the repo but without plugging it in yet.
    * Include the required zlib-ng license and version changes.
    * Remove the zlib-ng/doc/ and zlib-ng/tests/ folders and mention this in the newly added zlib-ng-version.txt file.
