    Add support for exported types in illink XML formats (#102487)
    
    Addresses the TODO in the native AOT port.
    
    Ran into inability of rooting things from mscorlib with the illink XML format on native AOT so decided to fix the TODO.
    
    (It was possible to work around with `Type.GetType` (that's a supported pattern) or rd.xml, but this should work with the descriptors too.)
