    Make SingleFile BundleID the expected length (12 bytes) (#116656)
    
    Originally, the BundleID of a singlefile bundle was 12 characters long from using GetRandomFileName, but this was changed to be a substring of a deterministic hash of a file in #52930. That change used SubString(12) instead of SubString(0, 12), so the BundleID was (HashAsBase64Length - 12) characters long. The BundleID is encoded as a variable-length field, so updating the length didn't cause issues then and isn't expected to cause issues here, and doesn't require a version bump.
