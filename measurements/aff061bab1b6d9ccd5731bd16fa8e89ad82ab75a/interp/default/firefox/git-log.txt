    Make sure ScopeStack doesn't box to IDisposable (#98396)
    
    We allocate every time we encounter a using (ScopeStack.PushScope...) statement, which adds up to be a lot (~10mb in hello world, one of the most allocated objects). Instead, we can return the struct type directly so no boxing occurs.
