    [cdac] Implement NibbleMap lookup and tests (#108403)
    
    * [cdac] Implement NibbleMap lookup and tests
    
       The execution manager uses a nibble map to quickly map program counter pointers to the beginnings of the native code for the managed method.
    
       Implement the lookup algorithm for a nibble map.
    
       Start adding unit tests for the nibble map
    
       Also for testing in MockMemorySpace simplify ReaderContext, there's nothing special about the descriptor HeapFragments anymore.  We can use a uniform reader.
    
    * NibbleMap: remove unused _codeHeaderSize field
    
    * cleanup NibbleMap and tests
    
    * NibbleMap: use a struct for MapUnit
    
    * Clarify termination condition; clean up docs
    
       Add an example
