    Track unknown value as result of unimplemented operations (#101752)
    
    Up until now, the analyzer has been set up to return `TopValue`
    for operations which are not handled by their own `Visit`
    overrides, to avoid producing warnings that are not produced from
    ILLink or ILC. This changes the default handling to return
    `UnknownValue.Instance`, so that such operations produce warnings
    if the return value flows into a location with dataflow
    requirements.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/101733, where the
    return value of a string interpolation operation (which doesn't
    have special handling in a `Visit` override) was not producing
    warnings when passed to `Type.GetType`.
