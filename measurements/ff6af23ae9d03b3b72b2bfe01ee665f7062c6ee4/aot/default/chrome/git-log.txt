    Remove GTF_GLOB_REF on a few more addressing nodes (#68741)
    
    GTF_GLOB_REF is necessary on a GT_ADDR node only if the child actually
    uses a tree with this flag as a value (and not as a location). This
    removes the flag in a few more places by using IsLocalAddrExpr.
    
    Fixes #68669
