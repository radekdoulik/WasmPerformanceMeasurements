    Introduce a mechanism to disable CLR tests under SuperPMI collection (#108873)
    
    It should be _extremely_ rare to need to disable a test during SuperPMI
    collection. However, one case was found, so introduce the ability to do so.
    
    Use `<SuperPmiCollectIncompatible>true</SuperPmiCollectIncompatible>` in
    a test project file.
    
    (which also requires `<RequiresProcessIsolation>true</RequiresProcessIsolation>`)
    
    Fixes #108215
