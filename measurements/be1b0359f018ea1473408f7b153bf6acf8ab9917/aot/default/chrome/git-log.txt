    Fix NegotiateStream connections between Linux clients and Windows servers (#99909)
    
    * Send the NegotiateSeal NTLM flag when client asked for
    ProtectionLevel.EncryptAndSign.
    
    Process the last handshake done message in NegotiateStream. In case of
    SPNEGO protocol it may contain message integrity check. Additionally,
    if the negotiated protocol is NTLM then we need to reset the encryption
    key after the message integrity check is verified.
    
    * Add test for the NegotiateSeal flag
    
    * Fix the test
    
    * Dummy commit
    
    * Fix the new _remoteOk logic in NegotiateStream to fire only when HandshakeComplete.
    
    If HandshakeComplete is not true, then the authentication blob will get processed with the normal flow.
    
    * Fix the value of NegotiateSeal in the final authentication message of Managed NTLM
