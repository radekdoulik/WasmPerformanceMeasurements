    Remove support for non-indirect code headers (#100351)
    
    - We use indirect code headers on all platforms (except for Windows X86, which has no particular reason to not use them)
      - Indirect code headers are required to support funclet style codegen, but work just fine in all cases.
    - This removes one of the ways in which Windows X86 is different from all other platforms
