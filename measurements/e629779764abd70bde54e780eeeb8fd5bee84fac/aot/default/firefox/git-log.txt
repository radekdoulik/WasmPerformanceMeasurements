    [cdac] Physical contract descriptor spec (#100365)
    
    Building on #100253 , describe an in-memory representation of the toplevel contract descriptor, comprisied of:
    * some target architecture properties
    * a data descriptor
    * a collection of compatible contracts
    
    Contributes to #99298
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/99299

    * [cdac] Physical contract descriptor spec
    
    * Add "contracts" to the data descriptor
    
    *  one runtime per module
    
       if there are multiple hosted runtimes, diagnostic tooling should look in each loaded module to discover the contract descriptor
    
    * Apply suggestions from code review
    
    * Review feedback
    
       - put the aux data and descriptor sizes closer to the pointers
    
       - Don't include trailing nul `descriptor_size`.  Clarify it is counting bytes and that `descriptor` is in UTF-8
    
       - Simplify `DotNetRuntimeContractDescriptor` naming discussion
