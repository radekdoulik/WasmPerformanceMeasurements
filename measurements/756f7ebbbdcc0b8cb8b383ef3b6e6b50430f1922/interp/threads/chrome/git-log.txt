    Add AOT annotations to System.Private.Xml and System.Data.Common (#109528)
    
    * Add AOT annotations to System.Private.Xml
    
    * Remove DAM from TypeDesc, add more annotations
    
    DAM on TypeDesc would require bubbling up RDC to parts of
    TypeScope (AddPrimitive of byte[]) that was unnecessarily viral.
    
    * Annotate System.Data.Common
    
    * Annotate a few serialization-related types at the type level
