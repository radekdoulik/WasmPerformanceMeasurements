    [RISC-V] Avoid using native layout info to calculate register flags for small structs where possible (#97877)
    
    * Remove initializing native layout info for small structs during type load
    
    Managed->managed calling convention should not depend on native info which is used for interop marshalling with unmanaged code which is above the type loader.
    
    * Don't use native layout in GetRiscV64PassStructInRegisterFlags unless we're calculating flags for a native value type
    
    * Remove redundant assertions, AsNativeValueType() has the same
    
    * Cover implied repeated fields, a.k.a fixed arrays, in when calculating small struct flags from non-native layout
    
    * Cover implied repeated fields, a.k.a fixed arrays, also in non-native branch of IsRiscV64OnlyOneField
