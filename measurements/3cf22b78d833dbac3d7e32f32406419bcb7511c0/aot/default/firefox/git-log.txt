    JIT: Template EH-specific checks in 3-opt layout (#111437)
    
    3-opt performs various checks within hot loops to maintain EH invariants. Since we know beforehand if the method has EH regions or not, we can save a bit of throughput in the latter case by skipping these checks. Also, relax an invariant around considering edges out of call-finally pairs.
