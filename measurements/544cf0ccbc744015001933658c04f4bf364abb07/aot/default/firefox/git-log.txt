    JIT: fix issue in cloning loops with trys in handlers (#113586)
    
    Loop cloning with EH had a bug when:
    * the loop contained a try T0 that was within a handler H1
    * the associated try T1 was also within the loop
    * the entire loop was within another try T2
    
    Here T0's containing try is T2, and its enclosing try index was properly
    adjusted when the EH table expands as part of cloning. We were doing another
    index adjustment later which lead to an out of bounds index.
    
    Also cleaned up the code that detects which try regions need cloning as in the
    above we only need to consider T1. When we go to clone it we also will clone H1
     and hence T2.
    
    Also fixed/added some more dumping, and some new test cases.
    
    This fix addresses a problem that came up stress testing #112998. Since the
    underlying bug does not require inlining to create the EH setup above,
    I am fixing it separately.
