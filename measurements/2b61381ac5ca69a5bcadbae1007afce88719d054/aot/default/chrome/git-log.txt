    Add IR support for modeling multiple SSA definitions as one store (#76139)
    
    * Change how we track use SSA numbers for partial defs
    
    Store them in the SSA descriptor instead of a map.
    
    Memory (x64): +0.18%
    PIN    (x64): -0.04%
    
    The memory regression is not small...
    
    * SsaNumInfo support
    
    * Support in SSA, VN and CopyProp
    
    For now, just the "CanBeReplacedWithItsField" case.
    This enables some nice simplifications, even as the
    general case gets more complex.
    
    Two quirks have been added to attain zero diffs.
    
    * Support in dumping
    
    * TP tuning
    
    Gets us back 0.05% on the PIN counter. Hard to believe but true.
    
    * More TP tuning
    
    Another 0.025%.
