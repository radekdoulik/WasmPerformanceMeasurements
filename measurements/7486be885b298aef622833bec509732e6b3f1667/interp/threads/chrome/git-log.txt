    [cdac] Data Descriptor Spec (#100253)
    
    Contributes to #100162 which is part of #99298
    
    Follow-up to #99936 that removes "type layout" and "global value" contracts and instead replaces them with a "data descriptor" blob.
    
    Conceptually a particular target runtime provides a pair of a logical data descriptor together with a set of algorithmic contract versions. The logical data descriptor is just a single model that defines all the globals and type layouts relevant to the set of algorithmic contract versions.
    
    A logical data descriptor is realized by merging two physical data descriptors in a proscribed order.
    
    The physical data descriptors provide some subset of the type layouts or global values.
    
    The physical data descriptors come in two flavors:
    
    - baseline descriptors that are checked into the dotnet/runtime repo and have well -known names
    - in-proc descriptors that get embedded into a target runtime.
    
    Each in-proc descriptor may refer to a baseline and represents a delta applied on top of the baseline.
    The data contract model works on top of a flattened logical data descriptor.
