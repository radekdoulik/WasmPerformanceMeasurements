    JIT: Check more invariants on ABI info and fix some arm32 bugs (#101372)
    
    - Implicit byref parameters should be passed as a single pointer sized segment
    - Segments should not point outside the local size
    - Segments should not overlap each other
    - Segments should have size > 0
    - Segments should be ordered by offset
    - Fix a bug in the arm32 classifier when structs are split
    - Fix a bug in the arm32 classifier for odd-sized structs with 8 byte alignment.
      For example
    ```csharp
    [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential, Size = 12)]
    struct S
    {
        public double X;
        public float Y;
    }
    ```
    would be considered to take 4 slots before.
    - Fix a bug in the Swift classifier that would cause the tail segments to have
      an out-of-bounds size
