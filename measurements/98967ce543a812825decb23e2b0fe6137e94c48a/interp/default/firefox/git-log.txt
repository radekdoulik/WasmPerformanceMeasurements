    Clean up ILLink logic for "inflating" generic types (#106211)
    
    - Avoid passing LinkContext through. This was only used to resolve the
      generic context type to get its parameter index, which was
      unnecessary.
    
    - Use non-nullable return type and simplify some callsites.
    
    This cleanup helps with
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/105345 - it makes it so we
    don't have to pass through LinkContext when operating on our proxy
    types just to get the generic instantiation.
