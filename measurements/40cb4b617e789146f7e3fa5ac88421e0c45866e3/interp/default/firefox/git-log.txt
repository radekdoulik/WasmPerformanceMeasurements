    Add JitOptRepeat configuration options (#100154)
    
    * Add JitOptRepeat configuration options
    
    JitOptRepeat is still off by default.
    
    1. Add a `DOTNET_JitEnableOptRepeat` option. By default this is zero,
    meaning OptRepeat is disabled. Set it to one to enable JitOptRepeat.
    Enabling it will allow OptRepeat to kick in during JitStress, but will
    not otherwise enable it. Also setting `DOTNET_JitOptRepeat` to a method set
    will enable JitOptRepeat for that exact set of methods. The number of
    repetitions is specified by `DOTNET_JitOptRepeatCount`.
    2. Enable JitOptRepeat to kick in for stress (if `DOTNET_JitEnableOptRepeat`
    is set to non-zero). The repetition count is set randomly (based on method
    hash seed) between 2 and 5.
    3. Add `DOTNET_JitOptRepeatRange`. This limits JitOptRepeat to a method hash
    range, for isolating JitOptRepeat related bad codegen.
    
    * Set `DOTNET_JitEnableOptRepeat=1` in tests that enable JitOptRepeat
