    Incremental mibc merge (#87336)
    
    Before this change, the merged mibc file would inherit the
    timestamp of the input (which are often days in the past, from
    the optimization data nuget package). This caused merging to
    happen on every incremental build, as dotnet-pgo.dll is always
    newer than the output file.
    
    The timestamp was inherited to fix a different incremental build
    issue, where updating to a newer optimization data package
    wouldn't make the input timestamp new enough to trigger a
    re-merge. See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/56397 for
    context.
    
    This fixes both issues by caching the input modification
    timestamps, so that the merged output file will get a new
    timestamp when it is created, but will be considered out of date
    whenever the input timestamps change.
    
    This reduces incremental build times on my machine by
    ~3s. Contributes to
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/47022
    
    Also deletes the --inherit-timestamp logic.
