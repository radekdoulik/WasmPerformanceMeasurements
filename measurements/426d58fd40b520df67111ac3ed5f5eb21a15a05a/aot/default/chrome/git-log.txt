    Fix stack overflow in compiler-generated state (#109207)
    
    When building the compiler-generated type info for a type, there are
    some cases that produce warnings due to unexpected IL. This can
    recurse back into the compiler-generated type info logic when checking
    for warning suppressions, leading to stack overflow.
    
    This fixes the issue by delaying the logging of warnings until after
    the compiler-generated type info has been fully built for a given
    type.
