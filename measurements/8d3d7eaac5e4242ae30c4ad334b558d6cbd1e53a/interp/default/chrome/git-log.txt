    Add delay load hook for singlefilehost and enable delay load of version.dll (#87495)
    
    `coreclr` delay loads `version.dll` and adds a hook such that it loads from the system directory. In single-file, we lost this behaviour since it uses static library version of `coreclr`. This adds the same mechanism to single-file.
