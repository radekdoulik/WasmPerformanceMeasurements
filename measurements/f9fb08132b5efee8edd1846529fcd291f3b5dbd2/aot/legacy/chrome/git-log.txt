    Import illink.targets for ref projects (#118144)
    
    This lets the logic from the ILLink targets add
    `AssemblyMetadata("IsTrimmable", "true")` to ref projects which have
    trimming enabled.
    
    Also moves the trimming opt-out into `Directory.Build.props` when it
    should be shared between src and corresponding ref projects.
    
    This will be used to enable the Roslyn analyzer to produce a warning
    for references to assemblies that aren't marked "IsTrimmable".
