    JIT: fix count reconstruction when a natural loop contains an improper loop (#100449)
    
    If a natural loop contains an improper loop, the cyclic probability computation
    for the natural loop will be an underestimate, as the cyclic probability computation
    assumes one pass convergence.
    
    In such cases count reconstruction may report convergence when it has not in
    fact converged, as any natural loop header ignores flow from its back edges, assuming
    their impact has been accounted for by the cyclic probability.
    
    So when a loop contains improper loops, fall back to normal iterative computation
    for the loop. We could use the cyclic probability initially as a convergence
    accelerator, but would need to switch over to not using it to guarantee full
    convergence. But that complicates the logic and these cases are rare.
