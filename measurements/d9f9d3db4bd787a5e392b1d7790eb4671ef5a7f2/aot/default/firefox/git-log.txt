    [EventPipe][UserEvents] Add copy of user_events structs (#116930)
    
    * [EventPipe][UserEvents] Add copy of user_events structs
    
    * Use hex representation
    
    * Various compiler warnings
    
    __attribute__((__packed__)) isn't declared in src/native
    uint8_t __reserved as a field name will somehow be interpreted as
    unsigned char
