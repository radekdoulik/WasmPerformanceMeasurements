    JIT: import entire method for OSR, prune unneeded parts later (#83910)
    
    For OSR compiles, always import from the original entry point in addition
    to the OSR entry point. This gives the OSR compiler a chance
    to see all of the method and so properly compute address exposure,
    instead of relying on the Tier0
    analysis.
    
    Once address exposure has been determined, revoke special protection
    for the original entry and try and prune away blocks that are no longer
    needed (we actually wait until morph).
    
    Fixes #83783.
    
    May also fix some of the cases where OSR perf is lagging (though
    don't expect this to fix them all).
