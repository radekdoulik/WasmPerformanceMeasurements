    Enable IDynamicInterfaceCastable tests disabled on fixed bug (#108376)
    
    These had to be excluded in #108235 but #108328 fixed them in the meantime. One of these PRs might be serviced for .NET 9 and the other may not, so I'm just reenabling this in a separate PR to make backports easier.
