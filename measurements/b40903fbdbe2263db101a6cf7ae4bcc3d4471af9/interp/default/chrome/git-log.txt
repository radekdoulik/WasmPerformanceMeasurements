    Zip async implementation (#114421)
    
    Added new public async APIs for System.IO.Compression and System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.
    Modified existing unit tests to validate both sync and async depending on an async argument.
    Added fuzzing tests for ZipArchive.
    Added new tests to confirm that no sync API is calling async APIs internally and viceversa.
