    JIT: Introduce `LclVarDsc::lvIsMultiRegDest` (#113294)
    
    With recent work to expand returned promoted locals into `FIELD_LIST`
    the only "whole references" of promoted locals we should see is when
    stored from a multi-reg node. This is the only knowledge the backend
    should need for correctness purposes, so introduce a bit to track this
    property, and switch the backend to check this instead.
    
    The existing `lvIsMultiRegRet` is essentially this + whether the local
    is returned. We should be able to remove this, but it is currently used
    for some heuristics in old promotion, so keep it around for now.
