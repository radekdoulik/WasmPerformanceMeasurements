    JIT: add missing recursive tail call detection logic (#93892)
    
    We now require that recursive tail calls be noted before morph by setting
    method and block flags. Add missing flag setting when devirtualization creates
    a recursive tail call candidate.
    
    Also add a diagnosic post-phase check to catch cases like this earlier.
    
    Fixes #93844.
