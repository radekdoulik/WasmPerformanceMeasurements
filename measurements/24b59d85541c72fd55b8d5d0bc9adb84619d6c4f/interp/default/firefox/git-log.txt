    Avoid concatenating adjacent regex loops+strings under right-to-left (#103591)
    
    The pattern gets reversed but the actual strings in multis aren't (instead the evaluation just compares them in reverse), which means optimizations based on comparing nodes in a sequence and the text of such a string either need to take that into account or be disabled for right-to-left.
