    Scalar/Packed conversions for floating point to integer (#97529)
    
    * merging with main
    Initial changes for scalar conversion double -> ulong
    
    * Basic working version of double -> ulong saturation
    
    * Moving the code in a do-while with proper checks to amke sure we are adding the fixup node at all cases
    
    * adjusting comments
    
    * Merging with main
    Saturating NaN to 0 and also adding Dbl2Ulng implementation in MathHelpers. Adding vector conversion support for double /float -> ulong conversion
    
    * removing conflicts from gentree.h flags
    merging with main
    doubel to uint conversion
    
    * float to uint conversion verified. removing commented code
    
    * merging with main. Making changes to simdashwintrinsic.cpp and
    listxarch.h
    float -> uint packed conversion
    
    * progress on double to long morphing
    
    * another attempt at double to long conversion
    
    * Merge with main
    Merge with main
    
    adding a new helper function ofr float to uint scalar conversion for SSE2.
    
    * adding handling for scalar conversion cases for SSE2. Remaining float/double -> long/int for AVX512.
    
    * partial changes for float to int conversion using double to int for avx512. vfixup not working. next step is to fix the vfixup instruction and get it working
    
    * adding float to int working scalar conversion case. Working on vectro case here on.
    
    * partial work on float to int packed conversion
    
    * partial version of float to int conversion
    
    * working version of float to int scalar/packed for avx512
    
    * complete conversions code for floating point to integral conversions for scalar/packed for SSE / avx512
    
    * Merging with main.
    fixing out of range test case adn adding conversion changes to simdashwintrinsic
    
    * fixing debug checks hitting asserts for TYP_ULONG and TYP_UINT at IR level
    
    * adding JIT_Dbl2Int for target_x86 and other architectures.
    
    * Supporting x86 for saturating conversions as well
    
    * fixing errors in packed conversion
    
    * accomodate unsigned in IR
    
    * adding evex support for cvttss2si
