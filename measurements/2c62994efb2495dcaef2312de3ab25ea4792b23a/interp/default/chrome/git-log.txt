    JIT: Regularize readbacks for parameters/OSR-locals in physical promotion (#87165)
    
    Handle readbacks for parameters/OSR-locals like any other readback is
    handled. Previously they were handled by creating the scratch BB and
    then inserting IR after the main replacement had already been done; now,
    we instead create the scratch BB eagerly and mark these as requiring a
    read back at the beginning of the scratch BB, and leave normal
    replacement logic up to handle it.
    
    The main benefit is that this unification makes it easier to ensure that
    future smarter handling of readbacks/writebacks (e.g. "resolution")
    automatically kicks in for the common case of parameters.
    
    Introduce another invariant, which is that we only ever mark a field as
    requiring readback if it is live. Previously we would always mark them
    as requiring read backs, but would then check liveness before inserting
    the actual IR to do the read back. But we don't always have the liveness
    information at the point where we insert IR for readbacks after #86706.
    
    Also expand some debug logging, and address some feedback from #86706.
