    Use correct product version in SPC in servicing (#110980)
    
    I noticed we missed to port the version changes from https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/108899#pullrequestreview-2371679935 to main. This does that so we embed the correct version number for `FrameworkDescription` into System.Private.CoreLib even during servicing when using the stabilized version.
    
    I simplified the source generator to pass the InformationalVersion msbuild property into the compilation instead of using reflection on the generator assembly.
