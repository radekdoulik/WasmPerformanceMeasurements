    Reduce allocations in `BinaryReader`. (#80331)
    
    * Use stack-allocated memory in `BinaryReader`'s `Read***` methods.
    
    * Avoid allocating `_buffer`.
    
    It now gets allocated only when calling the obscure `FillBuffer` method.
    
    * Use array slicing syntax.
    
    * Lazily allocate the `Decoder`.
    
    * Entirely remove the `_buffer` field in favor of array pool allocations.
    
    * Use array slicing syntax once more.
    
    * Remove the `_charBytes` field in favor of stack allocations.
    
    * Use `Unsafe.As` to cast to memory streams.
    
    We checked it on the constructor and already had asserts right before the casts.
    
    * Optimize `GetString` to directly decode the bytes into a string if it is small.
    
    * Use `sizeof`.
    
    * Address review feedback on `FillBuffer`.
    
    * Assign `_decoder` and `_charBuffer` only if the string is big.
    
    * Use Math.Min.
    
    * Declare variables where they are initialized.
    
    * Address review feedback.
