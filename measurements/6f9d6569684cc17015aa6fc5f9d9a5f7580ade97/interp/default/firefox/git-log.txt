    JitDump and other minor improvements (#96933)
    
    1. Make `DOTNET_JitDisasmAssemblies` apply to `JitDump` as well.
    2. Fix JitDump of `gsParamsToShadows`: it calls `fgMorphTree` which requires
    `compCurBB` to be set, but apparently only for JitDump.
    3. Various typos and formatting nits
