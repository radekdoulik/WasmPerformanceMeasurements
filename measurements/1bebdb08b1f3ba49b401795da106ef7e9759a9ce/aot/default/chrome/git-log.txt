    JIT: Generalize strategy for finding addrecs (#99048)
    
    When looking at a PHI, utilize a strategy where a symbolic node
    representing the recurrence is inserted in the cache, after which the
    analysis is invoked recursively. The created SCEV can afterwards be
    turned into a recurrence by considering the symbolic node to be a
    recursive occurrence.
