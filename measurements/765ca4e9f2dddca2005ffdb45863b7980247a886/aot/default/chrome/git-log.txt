    Disable msvc vectorization in GC get_promoted_bytes (#100309)
    
    This fixes the code generation rather than trying to address the symptoms of tests failing. Therefore, test Callback_Svr can be enabled again.
    
    See https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Bad-codegen-in-coreclr-GC-code/10625094. Issue may have been fixed already as later toolsets don't seem to show the issue, but this hasn't been verified.
