    Skip parsing types in ILLinkTrim.Descriptors if not needed (#79803)
    
    We should not even be using this parser (#79802). It's surprisingly slow to use this.
    
    This saves about 10% of wallclock time when compiling Hello World (yes, I can't believe my measurements either). We parse the descriptors for the purposes of manifest resources pretty late in the single threaded phase.
