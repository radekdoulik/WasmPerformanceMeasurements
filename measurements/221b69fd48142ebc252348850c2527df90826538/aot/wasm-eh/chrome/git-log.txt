    Tweak coreclr test build script (#81975)
    
    1. No longer use `-priority=1` syntax: use `-priority 1` instead.
    It was already documented this way, and probably works both ways on
    Windows because batch scripts "eat" the `=` sign sometimes.
    2. Fix a YML script to not pass the `=`. This is probably unused code
    currently because we build tests in CoreCLR on Linux.
    3. Add a few more `%MsgPrefix%` output lines.
