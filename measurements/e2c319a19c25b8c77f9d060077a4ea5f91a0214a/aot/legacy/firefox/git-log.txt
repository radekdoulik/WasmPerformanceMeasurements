    [android][ios] Fix dispose problem with NativeHttpHandlers (#93262)
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/90298 made sure the MetricsHandler was the top level handler for all NativeHttpHandler requests similar to what is done with SocketsHttpHandler. After creating the MetricsHandler, the code mistakenly disposed of `_nativeHandler`, which resulted in `Dispose` being called multiple times and eventually throwing a `Cannot access a disposed object` exception.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/93252
