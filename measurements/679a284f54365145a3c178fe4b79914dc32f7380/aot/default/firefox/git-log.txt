    EventSource startup initialization (#106014)
    
    * EventSource startup initialization
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/105845
    
    Previously MetricsEventSource wasn't being created for apps that didn't ever create a Meter. This caused a chicken-and-egg problem for RuntimeMetrics which weren't created until MetricsEventSource started a tracing session. This change ensures that MetricsEventSource will be created on demand if ETW, EventPipe, or EventListener based tooling starts a tracing session. I took some extra effort to create the EventSource in a deferred fashion to avoid eager loading System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource.dll when it might never be needed.
    
    Aside from the fix there were some small improvements:
    - Moved NativeRuntimeEventSource to initialize in the same place as other startup EventSources
    - Removed a useless lock(EventListener.EventListenersLock) around EventPipe eventProvider registration
