    JIT: Clean up `RefPosition` "killed registers" storage (#103560)
    
    Avoid some ifdefs and rename the field to reflect more specifically what it
    represents.
    
    Also avoid calling `getWeight` entirely for `RefTypeKill` ref positions, even
    for dumping. Dumping this info does not make much sense since there was a
    requirement that it was never called in non-dump paths anyway.
