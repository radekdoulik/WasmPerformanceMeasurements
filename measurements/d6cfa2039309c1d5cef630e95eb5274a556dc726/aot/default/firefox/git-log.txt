    SPMI: Ensure proper zero extension for isObjectImmutable and friends (#112617)
    
    Whether pointers are signed or unsigned is implementation defined,
    meaning that casts from a pointer to a 64-bit integer on 32-bit targets
    can be either zero or sign extended. SPMI provides `CastHandle` to
    handle this, but a couple of recording helpers were not using these.
