    Decompose some bitwise operations in HIR to allow more overall optimizations to kick in (#104517)
    
    * Decompose some bitwise operations in HIR to allow more overall optimizations to kick in
    
    * Ensure that we actually remove the underlying op
    
    * Ensure the AND_NOT decomposition is still folded during import for minopts
    
    * Ensure we propagate AllBitsSet into simd GT_XOR on xarch
    
    * Ensure that we prefer AndNot over TernaryLogic
    
    * Cleanup the TernaryLogic lowering code
    
    * Ensure that TernaryLogic picks the best operand for containment
    
    * Ensure we swap the operands that are being checked for containment
    
    * Ensure that TernaryLogic is simplified where possible
    
    * Apply formatting patch
