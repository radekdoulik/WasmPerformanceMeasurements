    [wasm] Fix perf pipeline (#91446)
    
    * workloads: Skip updating the targeting pack
    
    This is required because the runtime pack is still 8.0, but updating the
    targeting pack from the local build would make it 9.0, thus causing this
    error for non-wasm apps:
    
    ```
    Unhandled exception. System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The system cannot find the file specified.
    
    File name: 'System.Runtime, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'
    ```
    
    * [wasm] makefile cleanup
    
    * [wasm] Enable non-wasm build tests
