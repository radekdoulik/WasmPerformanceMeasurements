    Disable compile-native projects for linux-bionic (#100712)
    
    After https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/100623, the official build is broken. Our infrastructure for building native runtime component libraries using NativeAOT is failing for linux-bionic. Disable building on linux-bionic for now to unblock the build.
