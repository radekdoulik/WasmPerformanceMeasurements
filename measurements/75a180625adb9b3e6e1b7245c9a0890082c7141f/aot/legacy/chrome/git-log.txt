    [mono] Use underlying type in RuntimeHelpers.GetSpanDataFrom (#87019)
    
    * [mono] Use underlying type in RuntimeHelpers.GetSpanDataFrom
    
    Make it work correctly for spans of enums
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/86865
    
    Note that in net8 RuntimeHelpers.CreateSpan<T> is an intrinsic, so
    GetSpanDataFrom is never called directly.
    
    But in net7 CreateSpan is not intrinsified on Mono, so the underlying
    method really does get called.
    
    * test: Print all hidden field names if we can't find the right one
