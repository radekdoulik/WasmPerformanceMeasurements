    Updating Vector*.IsHardwareAccelerated to be recursive (#69578)
    
    * Updating Vector*.IsHardwareAccelerated to be recursive so it works in the debugger
    
    * Adding tests validating indirect and direct invocation of get_IsHardwareAccelerated return the same value
    
    * Ensure that Vector<T>.IsHardwareAccelerated supports being recursive
    
    * Apply suggestions from code review

    * Update src/libraries/System.Numerics.Vectors/tests/GenericVectorTests.cs
    
    * Detect the one legal violation of the behaves the same rule for intrinsics in CoreLib
    - The functions which detect if an intrinsic is actually available are allowed to have behavior which differs based on which intrinsics are available at runtime
    
    * [mono] Intrinsify IsHardwareAccelerated in the interpreter.
    
    * Add a fallback path for unhandled recursive intrinsics in System.Numerics
    
    * Move the Vector.IsHardwareAccelerated handling into SimdAsHWIntrinsicInfo.lookupId
    
    * Fixinng a compiler error due to an unresolved member
    
    * Adjust the NI_IsSupported_Dynamic checks to be NAOT only
