    Move tests from full facade folder to type forward destination (#94644)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/89230
    
    A previous changed moved full facade assemblies into src/libraries/shims
    but the tests were left in their original location.
    
    1. Move System.Data.DataSetExtensions/tests into System.Data.Common/tests
    and all other test projects under System.Runtime/tests.
    
    2. Update the tests.proj file that excludes based on the test project file
    paths.
    
    3. Delete System.AppContext/tests which already existed (as a copy)
       under System.Runtime/tests.
    
    4. Update System.Runtime.sln and System.Data.Common.sln
    
    5. Delete README.md files that are now unused and not required anymore.
