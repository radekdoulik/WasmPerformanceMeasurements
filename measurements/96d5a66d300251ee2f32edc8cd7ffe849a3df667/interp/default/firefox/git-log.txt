    JIT: Fix profiler enter callback init reg trash logic (#100637)
    
    During prolog generation we sometimes generate code to call the profiler
    enter callback. This may trash the "initReg" that we expect to keep
    zeroed during the prolog. The logic to check if the initReg was being
    trashed was wrong in a couple of cases:
    - Most backends did not take into account that the logic also trashes
      the registers used for arguments to the enter callback
    - SysV x64 thought that the enter callback trashed the parameter
      registers, but it does not
    
    This generally did not cause issues because `genFnPrologCalleeRegArgs`
    is unnecessarily conservative around whether or not it trashes
    `initReg`, and it comes after the profiler callback in the prolog.
    However, with the rewrite of the homing function that is not going to be
    the case anymore.
