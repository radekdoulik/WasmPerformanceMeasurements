    Support class target in RUC/RDC code fixers (#107956)
    
    This adds support to the RequiresUnreferencedCode and
    RequiresDynamicCode code fixer for adding new annotations at
    the class level. This helps while annotating libraries where static field
    initializers had trim/aot warnings.
