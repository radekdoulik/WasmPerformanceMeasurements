    Add edge likelihood dumping; fix one edge likelihood update case (#99740)
    
    1. Add dumping of edge likelihood numbers to the block table and other
    block dumping. Examples: `BB17(0.143)`, `BB18(1)`.
    
    Edge likelihood dumping is parameterized in the code, but is currently
    always enabled.
    
    2. Update `setLikelihood` and `updateLikelihood` to print the previous
    value of the likelihood that is being updated (if there is a previous value).
    
    3. Fix a case of likelihood updating in `fgReplaceJumpTarget()`: in a switch
    block, when the new target block is already a target of the switch, then there
    already exists an edge from the switch to the new target. In that case, we were
    updating the edge dup count, but `fgAddRefPred` wasn't updating the edge likelihood
    to add the removed edge likelihood to the existing edge likelihood.
    
    This was found as part of work to fix JitOptRepeat: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/94250.
    
    4. Add natvis debugger support for FlowEdge.
    
    5. In 'fgDebugCheckOutgoingProfileData()`, if outgoing likelihoods are invalid,
    print out all the likelihoods of the outgoing edges.
