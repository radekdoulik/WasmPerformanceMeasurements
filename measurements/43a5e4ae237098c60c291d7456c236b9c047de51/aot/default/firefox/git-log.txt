    Fix handling of corrupting state exceptions (#103048)
    
    * Fix handling of corrupting state exceptions
    
    The new EH is not correctly handling corrupting state exceptions.
    Instead of failing fast, the exceptions are actually handled like other
    exceptions and can be caught by the user code.
    
    This change fixes it. Besides fixing the issue, I had to introduce a way
    to trim exception handling code frames from the stack trace reported by
    the failfast, otherwise the output would be confusing.
    
    As an additional change, I've noticed that hardware exceptions under
    WinDbg don't trigger the WinDbg first chance exception mechanism. I've
    recently fixed the same for software exceptions, this adds the same for
    hardware ones.
    
    Close #103018
