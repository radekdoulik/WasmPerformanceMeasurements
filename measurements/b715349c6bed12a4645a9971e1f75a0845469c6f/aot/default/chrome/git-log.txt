    Report UnknownCredentials status on Unix/Managed NegotiateAuthenticationPal implementation for NTLM w/ default credentials. (#91160)
    
    This was handled inconsistently between the managed NTLM implementation and the GSSAPI one.
    Add test for the behavior.
    Add test to ensure SocketsHttpHandler using CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials with NTLM doesn't throw PNSE exception and returns the Unauthorized HTTP response instead.
