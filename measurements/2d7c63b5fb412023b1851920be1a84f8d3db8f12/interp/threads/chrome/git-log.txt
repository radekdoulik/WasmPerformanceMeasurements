    Deduplicate base interfaces from another assembly in COM generator (#111931)
    
    Fixes cross-assembly interface inheritance.
    
    Deduplicate external ComInterfaceInfos in the pipeline.
    
    Don't remove external interface methods in the generator pipeline - these are required to create the new VTable struct type introduced in #116289.
    
    Creates a new SourceAvailableIncrementalMethodStubGenerationContext for methods with source available and use IncrementalMethodStubGenerationContext as a base for externally defined methods.
    
    Moves the ComInterfaces from SharedTypes to the Common folder, and defines a limited set of base interfaces in SharedTypes for interfaces in ComInterfaceGenerator to derived from. Adds a number of tests for different levels of inheritance across assemblies.
