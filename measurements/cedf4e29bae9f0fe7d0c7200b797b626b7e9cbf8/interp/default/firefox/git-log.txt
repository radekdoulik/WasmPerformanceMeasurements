    JIT: revise `optRelopImpliesRelop` to always set `reverseSense` (#111803)
    
    Update clients to rely on `reverseSense` rather than parsing `vnRelation`.
    
    Also revised the and/or inference slightly as I found it hard to follow;
    hopefully it's clearer now.
    
    Fixes an issue that came up in testing #111766.
