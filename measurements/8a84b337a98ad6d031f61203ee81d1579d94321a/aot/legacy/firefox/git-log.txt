    JIT: Improve local assertion prop throughput (#94597)
    
    Leverage the "dep vectors" to avoid the search the assertion table during local assertion prop. Helps the current (small table) behavior some, helps the future cross-block (larger table) behavior more.
    
    Similar tricks may be possible for global AP, though the set of assertions there is more varied.
    
    Avoid merging assertions from statically unreachable preds. For OSR methods ensure the original method entry is considered reachable (as it may be).
    
    Contributes to #93246.
