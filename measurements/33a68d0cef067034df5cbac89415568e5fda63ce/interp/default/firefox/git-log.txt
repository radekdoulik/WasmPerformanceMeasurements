    Reduce generic specialized code in console formatters (#101474)
    
    Move code that doesn't need to be generic to a non-generic method. Reduces the size of the Stage 2 goldilocks app by 1.4% since these methods are rather large (especially the `JsonConsoleFormatter` one) and we have many specializations.
