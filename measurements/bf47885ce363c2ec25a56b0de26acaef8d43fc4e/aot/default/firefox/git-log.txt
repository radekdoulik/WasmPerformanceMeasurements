    Fix partial trimming of assemblies only referenced in metadata (#91713)
    
    runtime-extra-platforms are on the floor again after the rebrand to .NET 9 TFM PR.
    
    They're failing with an obscure:
    
    ```
    Unhandled exception. System.InvalidOperationException: Unable to get member, please check input for IsNativeAot.
       at Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions.DiscovererHelpers.Evaluate(Type calleeType, String[] conditionMemberNames) + 0xb6
       at Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions.DiscovererHelpers.<EvaluateArguments>d__13.MoveNext() + 0x209
    ```
    
    This is because `PlatformDetection.IsNativeAot` is not visible from reflection.
    
    Root caused this to:
    
    * `PlatformDetection` type is only referenced from `ConditionalFact` attribute. This attribute is not annotated with dataflow annotations, so the only thing we keep is the _metadata_ for the `PlatformDetection` type, since there's nothing else to keep (no methods, no MethodTable).
    * This is the _only_ reference to something from TestUtilities assembly.
    * Before the 9.0 rebrand PR, some nullable junk attributes were also generated into TestUtilities assembly. This basically helped us get _some runtime artifacts_ for _something_ in TestUtilities to be generated - when we were scanning attributes on PlatformDetection we'd say: oh this attribute needs a methodtable and a body for the constructor. This in turn triggered partial trimming logic to make _everything_ in TestUtilities reflection rooted.
    * After the 9.0 rebrand PR those attributes live in CoreLib, so nothing in TestUtilities gets a runtime artifact. Partial trimming logic is not looked at from TypeMetadata node.
    
    I'm fixing it by just explicitly rooting TestUtilities.
