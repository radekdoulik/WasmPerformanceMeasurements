    Store entry assembly path for easy access for diagnostics (#95027)
    
    - Add `g_EntryAssemblyPath` global variable holding the full path to the entry assembly
      - Set right before loading the entry assembly (so also before startup hooks are run) - NULL if there is no entry assembly
    - Ensure value is included dumps
      - For triage dumps, the dumped value is updated to only be the assembly file name instead of the full path
