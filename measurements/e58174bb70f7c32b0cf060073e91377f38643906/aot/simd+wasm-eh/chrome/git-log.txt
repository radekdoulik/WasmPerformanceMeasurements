    JIT: build pred lists before inlining (#81000)
    
    Move pred list building up a bit further. Note that this impacts both the root
    method and all inlinees, since we run a number of the initial phases on both.
    
    Since inlinees build their basic blocks and flow edges in the root compiler's
    memory pool, the only work required to unify the pred lists for a successful
    inline is to get things right at the boundaries. And for failed inlines there
    is no cross-referencing so we can just let the new pred lists leak away (like
    we already do for the inlinee blocks).
    
    Contributes towards #80193.
