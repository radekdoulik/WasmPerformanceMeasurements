    Ensure profiler test output is flushed (#117407)
    
    This might fix issue #114608
    
    These tests redirect profilee output to a parent which can cause it to get buffered. Given that the last line of output is
    missing but the Profiler.dll!Profiler::Shutdown message emitted just before is present it seems more likely that this
    is a buffering issue rather than a process crash in that small window. Notably, every other profiler Shutdown() method
    includes this fflush() call but it was missing for the transitions profiler.
