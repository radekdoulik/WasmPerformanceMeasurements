    [wasm] Correctly escape library names when generating symbols for .c (#79007)
    
    * [wasm] Correctly escape library names when generating symbols for .c files.
    Use the existing `FixupSymbolName` method for fixing library names too,
    when converting to symbols.
    
    * [wasm] *TableGenerator task: Cache the symbol name fixups
    .. as it is called frequently, and for repeated strings. For a
    consolewasm template build, we get 490 calls but only 140 of them are
    for unique strings.
    
    * Add tests
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/78992 .
