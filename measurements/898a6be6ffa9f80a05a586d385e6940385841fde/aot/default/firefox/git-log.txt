    [wasm] Add Vector128:ExtractMostSignificantBits (#75844)
    
    Implement `Vector128:ExtractMostSignificantBits` intrinsic. It is used in many places, so this should improve overall performance.
    
    Also fix typo in i16x8 version.
    
    The improvements are visible in the Json and Span measurements*:
    
    |                      measurement |    before |     after |
    | -------------------------------: | --------: | --------: |
    |              Span, IndexOf bytes |  0.3733us |  0.0992us |
    |              Span, IndexOf chars |  0.0031ms |  0.0027ms |
    |   Json, non-ASCII text serialize |  1.1966ms |  0.2430ms |
    | Json, non-ASCII text deserialize |  2.0456ms |  0.5030ms |
    |            Json, small serialize |  0.0437ms |  0.0274ms |
    |          Json, small deserialize |  0.0532ms |  0.0497ms |
    |            Json, large serialize | 13.6972ms |  7.4649ms |
    |          Json, large deserialize | 17.6993ms | 14.0079ms |
    
    * The above was measured with the aot compiler temporary hack to avoid shared generics in Span.
