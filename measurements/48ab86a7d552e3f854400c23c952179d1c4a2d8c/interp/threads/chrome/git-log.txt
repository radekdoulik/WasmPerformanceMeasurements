    Make host tests enable test-only behaviour for nethost before first use (#107170)
    
    On macOS with system integrity protection enabled, if a code-signed binary is loaded in a process, modified, and loaded again in another process, the second run will crash with Code Signature Invalid).
    
    Enabling test-only behaviour modifies the binary (re-writes a placeholder value). The nethost tests were enabling/disabling test-only behaviour for the same nethost binary used by all the tests. This change updates the tests to just always enable it before any use of the binary.
