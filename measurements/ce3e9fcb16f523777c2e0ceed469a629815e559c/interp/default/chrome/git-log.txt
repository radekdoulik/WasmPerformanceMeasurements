    Allow inline relocations in dehydrated data (#78545)
    
    This is a follow up to #77884. In the original pull request, all relocation targets went into a lookup table. This is not a very efficient way to represent rarely used relocs. In this update, I'm extending the dehydration format to allow representing relocations inline - instead of indirecting through the lookup table, the target immediately follows the instruction. I'm changing the emitter to emit this if there's less than 3 references to the reloc.
    
    This produces a ~0.5% size saving. It likely also speeds up the decoding at runtime since there's less cache thrashing. On a hello world, the lookup table originally had about 11k entries. With this change, the lookup table only has 1700 entries.
    
    If multiple relocations follow after each other, generate a single command with the payload specifying the number of subsequent relocations. This saves additional 0.1%.
