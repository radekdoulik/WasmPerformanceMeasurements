    Make single-file test cases delete extraction directory after test run (#116347)
    
    Single-file scenarios that bundle additional content (via non-default bundling options) extract to a directory at run time. For tests that redirect the extraction root, we delete the extraction directory. However, for tests that use the default extraction root ($HOME/.net, <getpwuid>/.net, or %TMP%/.net), we do not. Especially for self-contained, this can result in a lot of extracted files left over by the test run.
    
    - Update `BundledAppWithSubDirs` tests to delete the extraction directory used by the tests case
    - Add assertions for expected new or reused extraction
    - Make `NativeLibraries` specify the extraction root instead of using the default
    - Move tests for app launch failure out of `BundledAppWithSubDirs` to `AppLaunch` test class.
