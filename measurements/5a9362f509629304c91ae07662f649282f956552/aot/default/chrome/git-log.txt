    JIT: Add an "init BB" invariant (#110404)
    
    This adds an invariant that there always exists an "init BB" throughout
    the JIT's phases. The init BB has the following properties:
    - It is only executed once, so it does not have any predecessors
    - It is not inside a try region, hence it dominates all other blocks in
      the function
    
    There are no further requirements on the BB. The init BB does not have
    to be `BBJ_ALWAYS` (unlike the old "scratch BB" concept). This is mainly
    because it philosophically does not make sense to insert IR at the end
    of the init BB, since earlier phases can have inserted arbitrary IR in
    them.
