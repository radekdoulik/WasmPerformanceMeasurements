    Allow data dehydration even if CFG is enabled (#106133)
    
    I chose to disable this for CFG but I don't understand why. On one hand it allows more data to be in the read-only segment, which is good for security, but on the other hand we already validate all indirect jumps so corrupting a pointer here still wouldn't lead to control flow hijack. It can still be disabled with an undocumented switch.
