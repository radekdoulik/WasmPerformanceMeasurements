    Turn unreachable basic blocks into an infinite loop (#98319)
    
    Instead of padding unreachable basic blocks with nops followed by `br $-2`, we now turn unreachable basic blocks into _just_ `br $-2`, no nops (and matching basic block size) needed. This means offsets within the method body can shuffle around and we fix them up.
