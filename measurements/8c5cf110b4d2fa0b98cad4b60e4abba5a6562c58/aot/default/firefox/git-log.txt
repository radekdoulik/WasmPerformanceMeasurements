    [mono][jit] Adding compare all/any intrinsics. (#83515)
    
    * xxAny, xAll comparisons in progress.
    
    * xxAny, xxAll comparisons, part 2.
    
    * [mono][jit] Adding compare all/any operations. Fixed umov,smov macros.
    
    * Removed superfluous changes.
    
    * Restored newline at the end of HelloWorld.
    
    * Fixed unmatched brace.
    
    * Indentation.
    
    * Normalized boolean values to 0/1. SIMD_EXTR_ constants have friendlier names. Equality/Inequality are now also intrinsics.
    
    * Fixed element type for comparisons.
    
    * Temporarily disabled intrinsics. Will be permanenty reenabled once all are implemented.
