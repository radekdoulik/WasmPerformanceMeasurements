    Allow muxer behind Windows symlink (#99576)
    
    The current logic for the muxer (dotnet.exe) doesn't resolve through symlinks
    on Windows. For instance, it looks next to the entry point path for things like
    hostfxr. This means that you cannot use a symlink to dotnet.exe, as it will look
    next to your symlink for the runtime, rather than next to the target of the symlink.
    
    This PR fixes the problem just for the muxer. To do so, it introduces a new API:
    fullpath. The existing realpath API has the behavior of always resolving symlinks
    on Unix, and never resolving symlinks on Windows. The new `fullpath` API replicates
    this behavior, while the old `realpath` API is changed to always resolve symlinks on
    both Unix and Windows. Then, the realpath API is used in appropriate places when
    resolving paths relative to the muxer to guarantee resolving through symlinks on
    all platforms.
    
    Fixes #83314
