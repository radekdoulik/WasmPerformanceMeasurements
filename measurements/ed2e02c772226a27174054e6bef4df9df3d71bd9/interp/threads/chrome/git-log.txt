    Ensure proper cleanup of key files when not persisting them
    
    Code inspection suggested that keys imported into the CNG MachineKey store
    from PFXImportCertStore were not getting properly cleaned up.  This change
    adds tests that prove that supposition, and then fixes the bug so they pass.
