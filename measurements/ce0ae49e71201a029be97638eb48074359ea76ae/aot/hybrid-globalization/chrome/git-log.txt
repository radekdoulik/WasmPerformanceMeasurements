    Add managed blocking info for lock and monitor waits (#101192)
    
    * Add managed blocking info for lock and monitor waits
    
    - Added a managed `ThreadBlockingInfo` struct that is similar to CoreCLR's `DebugBlockingItem`
    - Updated `Lock`, `Condition`, and `Monitor` to record the info
    - The `LockOwnerOSThreadId` and `LockOwnerManagedThreadId` properties can be used by debuggers to determine which thread owns a lock that the current thread is waiting on
      - In CoreCLR, `Monitor` records the info using the `Monitor` object kinds. In NativeAOT, `Lock` and `Condition` are used for `Monitor` waits, so the object kinds would be `Lock/Condition`. For now, Mono's `Monitor` does not record this info.
