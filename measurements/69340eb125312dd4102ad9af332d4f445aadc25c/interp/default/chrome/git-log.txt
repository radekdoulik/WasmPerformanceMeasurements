    Fix ComponentGovernance running on public PR/CI jobs (#99898)
    
    This seems to be a side-effect of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/99179
    
    Arcade checks whether `disableComponentGovernance` is the empty string to apply the default skipping logic: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/ace00d8719b8d1fdfd0cc05f71bb9af216338d27/eng/common/templates/job/job.yml#L168-L174
    
    Changed our templates to make sure we pass that correctly.
