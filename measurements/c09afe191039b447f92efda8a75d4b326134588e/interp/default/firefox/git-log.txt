    * Cleanup
    
    * Structure the loops like the re-entrant wait handling, insert a try-finally block around the re-entrant wait loop
    
    * Add ifdef around flag only used on Windows
    
    * Check interrupt before we wait (in case the APC ran at thread startup).
    
    Change check to assert.
    
    * Update Thread.NativeAot.Windows.cs

    * Use Timeout constants and move state clearing to be manually done before throwing the exception instead of in a finally block
    
    * Fix the "unstarted" interrupt case
    
    * Remove null checks and only attach uninitialized threads
