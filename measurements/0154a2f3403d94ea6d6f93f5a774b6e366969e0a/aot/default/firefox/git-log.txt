    [NRBF] Address issues discovered by Threat Model  (#106629)
    
    * introduce ArrayRecord.FlattenedLength
    
    * do not include invalid Type or Assembly names in the exception messages, as it's most likely corrupted/tampered/malicious data and could be used as a vector of attack.
    
    * It is possible to have binary array records have an element type of array without being marked as jagged
