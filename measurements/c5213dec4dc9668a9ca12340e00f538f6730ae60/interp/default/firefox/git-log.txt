    Enable more ILLink test cases with native AOT (#110166)
    
    When I was working on the `DAMT.All*`, I noticed we don't run many Reflection tests, this is progress towards that.
    
    Also fixes rare `CreateInstance` overloads - these were never worth the effort to implement honestly, but more code sharing made implementing them a breeze.
    
    Contributes to #82447.
