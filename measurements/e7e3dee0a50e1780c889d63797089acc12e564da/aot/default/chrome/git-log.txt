    Mention NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy for PublicSign (#99184)
    
    * Update public-signing.md
    
    * Specify "may" because we've seen it work on some machines but not others.
    
    It's not clear to use what the difference is other than a hunch that it fails on Windows Server but works fine on Windows Client OS.
    
    * Add missing angle bracket
