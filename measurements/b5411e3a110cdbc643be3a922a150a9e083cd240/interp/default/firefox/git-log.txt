    Vectorize TensorPrimitives.Sin/Cos (#98194)
    
    * Vectorize TensorPrimitives.Sin/Cos
    
    * Clean up implementation
    
    * Split Sin/CosOperator into separate float/double types
    
    * Manually inline POLY_EVAL_ODD_*
    
    And make a few things more consistent
    
    * Address remaining PR feedback
    
    Also move some tests to outerloop to decrease inner loop testing time
