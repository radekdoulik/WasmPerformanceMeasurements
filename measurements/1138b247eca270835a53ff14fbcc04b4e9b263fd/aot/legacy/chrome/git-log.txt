    Remove `AssemblyMetadata(".NETFrameworkAssembly", "")` attributes (#89490)
    
    * Remove `AssemblyMetadata(".NETFrameworkAssembly", "")` attributes
    
    This is likely a .NET Native leftover that is currently (ironically) breaking .NET Native. This attribute indicates to the .NET Native compiler that the assembly can be trimmed.
    
    We're currently setting this on assemblies that no longer carry RD.XML to make this safe. Without this attribute, the assembly will be treated like any other and not trimmed.
    
    Fixes #44697.
    
    * Delete mention of the attribute in docs
