    Fix handling of IDynamicInterfaceCastable wrt CastCache (#108328)
    
    Fixes #108229.
    
    The actual fix is the addition of an `if` check where it originally wasn't. I also fixed the other checks for consistency - positive checks are fine to cache, and negative checks against non-interface targets are also fine to cache.
