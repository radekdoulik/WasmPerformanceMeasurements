    JIT: Add a primitive to split statements at a specified tree (#83005)
    
    Add a gtSplitTree that can split a statement at an arbitrary tree: this creates new statements before the statement such that the original statement now executes the input tree as the very first non-invariant node.
    
    This can be used for example to introduce control flow at an arbitrary point within a tree.
