    [wasm] Increase jiterpreter limits (#107557)
    
    * Raise module size limit to 16KB (from past testing this is a good compromise value that can actually reduce number of traces compiled and time spent compiling them)
    * Raise total wasm bytes limit a bit since the modules are now bigger
    * Raise switch case limit to 128, so switch statements over the 7-bit ASCII character range can be jitted. I expect this to improve text parsing performance; it might be worth raising it to 256.
