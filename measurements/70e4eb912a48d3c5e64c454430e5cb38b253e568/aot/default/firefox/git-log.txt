    JIT: use bbID for pred list ordering (#108357)
    
    Make `bbID` available in release builds, and use it to control the order
    of edges in the pred list. This removes (almost all) the need for reordering
    pred lists when blocks are renumbered (`bbNum` changes, but `bbID` doesn't).
    
    Also remove the need for sorting pred lists; in the one remaining place
    where sorting might be needed, just remove, modify, and then re-add the edge.
