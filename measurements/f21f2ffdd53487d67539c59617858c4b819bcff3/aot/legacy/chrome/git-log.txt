    Tweak and fix physical promotion test environments (#89380)
    
    - Physical promotion is enabled by default now, so switch the scenario to one
      that tests physical promotion without old promotion
    
    - JitStressModeNames was missing from DOTNETVariables, which meant that after
      the switch from JitEnablePhysicalPromotion to JitStressModeNames we stopped
      testing the right thing
