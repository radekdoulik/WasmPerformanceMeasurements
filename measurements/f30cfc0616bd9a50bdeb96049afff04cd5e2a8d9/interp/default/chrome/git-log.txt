    All `WasmBuildTests` use static project from assets or `dotnet new`, unification of browser tests (#109069)
    
    * Fix build errors in WASI - refactor of WASI in a future PR.
    
    * Fix binlog location.
    
    * Update README.
    
    * Feedback: non-nullable _projectDir.
    
    * Fix `SatelliteAssembliesTests` and other test that require 3 states of `WasmBuildNative`
    
    * `RebuildTests` fix after introducing figerprinting.
    
    * Fix no-worklod tests: 1) do not double-assert `AssertRuntimePackPath` in blazor 2) `AssertRuntimePackPath` is correct  only when workload is there 3) NativeBuild should allow undefined in blazor tests as well.
    
    * Fix `NativeBuildTests` - AppBundle was not asserted here originally.
    
    * `WasmGenerateAppBundle=false` when workloads used (set in workload manifest). The check is incorrect in the current process of testing.
    
    * Fix `MainWithArgsTests`. Url query can have arg key duplicates -> is better represented by `NameValueCollection` than `Dictionary`
    
    * AppBundle was never asserted for size in `OptimizationFlagChangeTests` + use statistics that are fingerprinting insensitive.
    
    * Reading from config is a known issue.
    
    * Fix `ReferenceNewAssemblyRebuildTest`: Json lib was already referenced before the change in the test. Use Cryptography lib instead.
    
    * Keep blazor workload tests together.
    
    * Fix: `PInvokeTableGeneratorTests` on Windows.
    
    * Move all no-workload blazor tests to one class.
    
    * Use more meaningful name for `MiscTests3`.
    
    * `PInvokeTableGeneratorTests` takes 2-3 times more time than average WBT class, divide it.
    
    * Block the timeouting test with exisiting issue.
    
    * Try avoiding port collisions in blazor tests run on kestrel.
    
    * Removal of files and comments that were supposed to be deleted after approval.
