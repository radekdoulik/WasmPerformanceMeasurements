    Enable option to use the Windows ThreadPool (#85373)
    
    When running on Windows, enable an option to switch between the Portable thread pool and the Windows thread pool.
    
    This change targets NativeAOT, CoreCLR, and Mono.
    
    Windows threadpool remains as the default for NativeAOT on Windows. For any other case the Portable thread pool remains the default.
    
    Tests with the Windows thread pool enabled were added to the System.Threading.Threadpool solution.
    
    Trimming is enabled to remove the unused thread pool.
