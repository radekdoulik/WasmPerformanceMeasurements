    [wasm] Codespaces need more disc to succeed building on container creation (#99803)
    
    * Debug
    
    * Building steps logging.
    
    * Chop up restore and clean cache in between
    
    * Restore does not take as much space as codespaces setup files in "/workspaces/.codespaces".
    
    * Try removing the biggest offender.
    
    * Cannot see the impact of cleanup on the size check logs.
    
    * Move setup code into post-create
    
    * Pass arg to the script, otherwise nothing is triggered
    
    * Move all commands up to restore to onCreate. Restore should be done after codespaces setup when occupied disc space drops.
    
    * Fix: wasm does not have artifacts dir on writing to this file.
    
    * This would work but is not 100% reliable - user can interact with the VM before the command finishes.
    
    * Build subset by subset.
    
    * Easy fix - requre bigger disc.
