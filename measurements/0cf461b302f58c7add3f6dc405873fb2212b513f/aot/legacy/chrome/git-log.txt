    [ILLink analyzer] Move generic parameter analysis to dataflow (#95482)
    
    Move generic parameter analysis to dataflow and align behavior
    more closely with NativeAot.
    
    Roughly follows the implementation approach used by NativeAot in
    GenericArgumentDataFlow.cs to make it easier to share the
    logic (without actually sharing the code for now).
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/95121.
    
    Some notes on the behavior:
    
    - Gets rid of some analyzer warnings in cases where NativeAot
      doesn't warn either
    
    - Doesn't warn for generics in `typeof`
    
    - Doesn't warn for generics in signatures of reflectable
      members (ILC does this to work around an incorrect suppression
      in DI, as discussed in
      https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/81358).
    
    - Generics in base types or interface types are still analyzed
      outside of dataflow
