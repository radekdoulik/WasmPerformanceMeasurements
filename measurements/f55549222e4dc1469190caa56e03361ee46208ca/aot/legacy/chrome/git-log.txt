    JIT: Fix invalid smnegl transformation (#93003)
    
    * JIT: Fix invalid smnegl transformation
    
    The newly introduced TryLowerNegToMulLongOp would always lower to a
    signed multiplication, even for unsigned multiplications.
    
    Also apply a couple of other fixes to the transformation:
    * Replace uses of GenTree::ReplaceWith with LIR::Use::ReplaceWith
    * Add some necessary interference checks
    
    Fix #92537
    
    * Add test
