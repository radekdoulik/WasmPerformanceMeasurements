    JIT: morph blocks in RPO (#94247)
    
    When optimizing, process blocks in RPO. Disallow creation of new blocks
    and new flow edges (the latter with certain preapproved exceptions).
    
    Morph does not yet take advantage of the RPO to enable more optimization.
    
    Contributes to #93246.
