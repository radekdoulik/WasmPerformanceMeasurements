    Better ARM intrinsics implementation for dn_simdhash (#113095)
    
    * New ARM NEON implementation of find_first_matching_suffix_simd
    * Restrict neon implementation to arm64 because arm32 neon doesn't have wide vector registers
    * Cleanup simdhash arch header and remove redundant assert
