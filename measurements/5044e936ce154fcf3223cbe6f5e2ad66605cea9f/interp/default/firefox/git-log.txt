    Use RtlDllShutdownInProgress to detect process shutdown on Windows (#103877)
    
    * Use RtlDllShutdownInProgress to detect process shutdown on Windows
    
    Switching to cooperative mode is not safe during process shutdown on
    Windows. Process shutdown can terminate a thread in the middle of the
    GC. The shutdown thread deadlocks if it tries to switch to cooperative
    mode and wait for the GC to finish in this situation.
    
    Use RtlDllShutdownInProgress Windows API to detect process
    shutdown to skip cleanup that has to be done in cooperative mode.
    
    The existing g_fProcessDetach flag is set too late - using this flag to
    skip cooperative mode switch would lead to shutdown deadlocks, and the
    existing g_fEEShutDown flag is set too early - using this flag to skip
    cooperative mode switch would lead to shutdown crashes.
    
    Fixes #103624
    
    * Replace direct g_fProcessDetach checks with a call to IsAtProcessExit
