    JIT: Model JIT helper exceptions correctly in VN (#101062)
    
    The JIT currently models all exceptions thrown by helpers with a
    singleton VN. This can cause CSE to remove exception side effects
    incorrectly.
    
    This change starts modelling exceptions thrown by the following helpers
    accurately:
    - The R2R cast helper
    - Division helpers
    - Static constructor base helpers
    
    Remaining JIT helpers are modelled conservatively, with an opaque VN in
    the exception part.
    
    Contributes to #63559
    Fix #101028
