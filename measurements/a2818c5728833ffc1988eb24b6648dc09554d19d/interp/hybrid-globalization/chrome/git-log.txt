    Include info about system call errors in some exceptions from operating on named mutexes (#92603)
    
    * Include info about system call errors in some exceptions from operating on named mutexes
    
    - Added new PAL APIs for creating and opening mutexes that take a string buffer for system call error info. These are called with a stack-allocated buffer and upon error the system call errors are appended to the exception message.
    - When there is a system call failure that leads to the PAL API failing, some info is appended to the error string, including the system call, relevant arguments, return value, and `errno`
    - `chmod` on OSX seemingly can be interrupted by signals, fixed to retry. Also fixed a couple other small things.
