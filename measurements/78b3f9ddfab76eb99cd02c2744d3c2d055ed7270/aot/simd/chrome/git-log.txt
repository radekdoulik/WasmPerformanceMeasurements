    NativeAOT exports marked functions for exe apps. (#78738)
    
    Functions decorated with the attribute UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute
    are not inserted in the export table of the compiled file when the
    .NET project is an executable (i.e., as opposed to a library).
    This change removes the difference between a library and an executable
    regarding the handling of the attribute UnmanagedCallersOnlyAttribute.
    As such, decorated functions with this attribute are now adequately
    exported for libraries and executables.
    
    Fix #78663
