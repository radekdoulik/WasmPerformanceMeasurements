    [wasm] Fix blazor startup measurements (#93696)
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/93548 introduced a typo, which caused the blazor
    startup measurements to not load the page completely.
    
    The snapshot version is still not loading right, that's probably because we don't use
    https yet.
