    * Fix misleading order of EventSource log and AcquireClientCredentials call
    
    Discovered while investigating #119259. `AcquireClientCredentials` produces other events as well, so the order in the log is misleading and makes investigations harder.
    
    * Update src/libraries/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslStream.Protocol.cs
