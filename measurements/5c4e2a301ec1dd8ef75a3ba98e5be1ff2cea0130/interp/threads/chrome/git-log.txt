    Remove remaining CRT PAL wrappers and enable including standard headers in the CoreCLR build (#98336)
    
    - Remove malloc-family PAL and update callsites that might get passed 0 to bump up to 1.
    - Move `getenv` usage to use the `PAL` function directly when on non-Windows (to preserve the existing behavior).
    - Remove other remaining CRT PAL shims
    - Remove header shims and enable building with the CRT and STL headers across the product, with various build fixes required (mostly around using the standard min/max definitions)
