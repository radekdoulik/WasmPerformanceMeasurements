    Mark managed/Compilation test as NativeAotIncompatible (#100625)
    
    The issues.targets exclusion doesn't seem to kick in with the merged wrapper, but whatever: this test compiles into a 100 MB executable because it includes a fully rooted Roslyn, and doesn't work anyway. Stop building it.
