    Fix NativeAOT publish failure on fi_FI culture (#98552)
    
    This culture uses `U+2212 : MINUS SIGN` instead of `-` for negative numbers which trips up msbuild when comparing the property.
    Instead of using an intermediate property just inline the usage and use `Contains()` for better readability.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98550
