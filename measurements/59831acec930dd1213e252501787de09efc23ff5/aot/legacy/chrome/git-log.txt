    [wasm][mt] Improve blocking wait detection and tests (#98045)
    
    * [wasm][mt] Improve blocking wait detection and tests
    
    Add check to the `SemaphoreSlim.Wait`. The wait will eventually continue
    to the `Monitor.Wait`, it can spin wait first though and return, so catch
    it earlier to avoid non-deterministic behavior.
    
    Improve the blocking wait detection and extract it to the new method. Also
    introduce helper method to force a blocking wait in places we want it
    on the JS interop threads.
