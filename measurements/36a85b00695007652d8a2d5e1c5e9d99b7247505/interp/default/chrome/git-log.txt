    Propagate the 'this' keyword in LibraryImports (#102793)
    
    Since Roslyn just lowers the extension methods to a call to the static method there's no reason we shouldn't support creating extension methods that are also LibraryImport methods. This adds the IsExplicitThis property to TypePositionInfo and copies this to the generated signature if it is true.
