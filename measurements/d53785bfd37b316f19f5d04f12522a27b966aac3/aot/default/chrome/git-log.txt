    Avoid marking types as reflected on in CreateSpan (#118832)
    
    This seems to be at least one of the reasons why Hello World on Linux still needs support for boxed enums. `CreateSpan` is used with an enum type in Unix System.Console, which brings a boxed enum into whole program view and we can't undo the damage this causes to the whole program view during compilation anymore (even though we no longer need the `typeof` then because RyuJIT always expands `CreateSpan`).
