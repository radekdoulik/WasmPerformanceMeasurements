    JIT: Insert writebacks more eagerly (#87869)
    
    Before starting replacements within a statement we now look for
    physically promoted struct locals passed as call args and write those
    back if necessary. This has two benefits:
    1. It avoids creating a lot of comma nodes that we would otherwise
       create
    2. More importantly, it allows morph's last-use copy omission to kick in
       because we no longer have complex trees as the argument.
    
    Fix #87471
