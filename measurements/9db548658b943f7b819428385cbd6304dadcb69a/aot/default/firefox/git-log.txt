    * Adjust message about repro file for a merged test
    
    For now the script ./src/tests/run.py outputs "Failed to create repro for test" for a failed merged test.
    
    But this comment
    
    1288                     if assembly_is_merged_tests_run:
    1289                         # REVIEW: Even if the test is a .dll file or .CMD file and is found, we don't know how to
    1290                         # build a repro case with it.
    
    from ./src/test/run.py script says that for a merged test a repro file should not be created at all.
    
    Changing the message "Failed to create repro for test" to "Skipping repro for merged test".
