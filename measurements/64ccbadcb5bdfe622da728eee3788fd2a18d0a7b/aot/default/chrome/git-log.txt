    * Enable lookarounds to influence atomicity
    
    As part of our auto-atomicity handling, today we give up when the subsequent node is a lookaround. This improves it to support the case when the subsequent node is a positive lookahead.
    
    * Update src/libraries/System.Text.RegularExpressions/tests/UnitTests/RegexReductionTests.cs
