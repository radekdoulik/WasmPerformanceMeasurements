    Fix NullableAttribute illink test failures (#90449)
    
    When we started building with preview 7 in
    5549f72da3b3cea9e74bb81cfbb0f2d27731fc42, NullableAttribute in
    these testcases started to use the attribute definition from the
    framework, instead of generating it into the code. This broke the
    `--used-attrs-only` optimization because `skip` assemblies (the
    default for the framework in these testcases) are treated as if
    all types in them are kept, for the purposes of the
    `--used-attrs-only` optimization. (The optimization removes
    attribute instances unless the attribute type is preserved for
    some other reason).
    
    It's not clear what the intended behavior of `--used-attrs-only`
    is for `skip` assemblies, and the discussion in
    https://github.com/dotnet/linker/issues/952 indicates that it's
    considered experimental, so this fixes the failures by using the
    `link` action. This represents a more realistic scenario since
    `skip` is mainly used in testing to avoid linking the framework
    in every testcase.
