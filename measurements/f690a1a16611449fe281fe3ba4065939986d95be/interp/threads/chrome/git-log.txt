    [android] Fix build with newer NDK (#103233)
    
    Newer versions of Android NDK (tested with 26.3) no longer include
    support for 32-bit host machines and have moved libraries around for
    that reason.  One of the libraries that changed its location is
    `libclang.so`, required to build MonoVM for Android.
    
    This PR adds support to detect the library at its new location.
