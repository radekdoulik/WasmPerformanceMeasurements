    Fix CET debugger stepping over CALL instructions (#108809)
    
    * Initial changes to support in-place single-stepping over call instructions from out of process
    
    * ThreadSuspension WIP
    
    * Change how in-place single step is tracked
    
    * Pass fSSCompleted to the right side
    
    * Only suspend other threads for in-place single step
    
    * Add thread resume in HandleSetThreadContextNeeded
    
    * ScanForTriggers should return DebuggerPatchSkip
    
    * Refactor out of proc thread suspension into CordbThread
    
    * Avoid using DebuggerPatchSkip for tracking in-place single step on left side, and resume threads on the right side before the left side is notified
    
    * Track InplaceSteppingThreads at the process level on the RS, ApplyRemotePatch/RemoveRemotePatch for patch writing
    
    * Block detach if m_inplaceSteppingThreads is not empty
    
    * Refactor InplaceSteppingThreads impl
    
    * Track thread create and exit for thread suspension
    
    * Change comments to minimize size of change
    
    * Fix blank space diff
    
    * Keep track of single step thread suspension count at the process level
    
    * Cleanup and correctly pass bool from LS to RS
    
    * Workaround crash caused by SSP restore on fake context
    
    * Change page protections when clearing or writing breakpoints
    
    * Remove debug output and perform some cleanup
    
    * Track unmanaged threads with SHash instead of unordered_map
    
    * Revert "Workaround crash caused by SSP restore on fake context"
    
    This reverts commit 874c465495edef0c85f55bdda9a82850c68a9af6.
    
    * Fix func-eval abort with minimal code change
    
    * Apply suggestions from noahfalk

    * Always define IsInPlaceSingleStep and return false if not implemented
    
    * CR feedback from mikelle-rogers - correctly set begin iterator for suspending/resuming/closing threads
