    Make host error message include pointer to architecture for Windows library load failure with ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT (#107063)
    
    Check for `ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT` and include a pointer towards architecture mismatch in the error message. This is only on Windows - we don't have a good way of detecting this on non-Windows - dlopen will fail and the host will just print the message from dlerror.
    
    This also removes the comment/link to install .NET prerequisites. I don't think there's anything there that would be helpful for the case of we found the library, but the operating system call to load it failed.
