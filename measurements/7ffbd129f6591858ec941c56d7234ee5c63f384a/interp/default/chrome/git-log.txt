    Create ReadOnlySpan marshaller for ManagedToUnmanagedOut scenarios (#101095)
    
    Provides a marshaller for ReadOnlySpan<T> for ManagedToUnmanagedOut direction. We have marshallers for UnmanagedToManagedOut and ManagedToUnmanagedIn. This API wasn't created previously due to the assumption that the managed ReadOnlySpan<T> would need to be written to in generated marshaling code, but that isn't strictly necessary for stateful marshallers. This API would allow LibraryImport methods to return ReadOnlySpan<T> without creating a new marshaller or specifying the marshaller type in the method definition.
