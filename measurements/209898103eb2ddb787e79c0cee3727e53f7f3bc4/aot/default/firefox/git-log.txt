    JIT: very simple cloning heuristic (#108771)
    
    Avoid cloning large loops.
    
    We compute loop size by counting tree nodes of all statements of all
    blocks in the loop. If this is over a threshold, we inhibit cloning.
    
    Threshold value was chosen based on distribution of unrestricted cloned
    loop sizes in the benchmark run_pgo collection.
