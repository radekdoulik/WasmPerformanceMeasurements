    Fix assert in Thread::VirtualUnwindCallFrame on ARM64 (#102350)
    
    My recent change to fix windows arm64 unwinding for native code has
    started to trigger an assert in jitstress tests. The problem is that the
    codeinfo that is passed to the Thread::VirtualUnwindCallFrame in case of
    managed frames was created from an unadjusted PC, while the check that
    we use to verify the codeinfo validity in debug builds gets the function
    entry from the OS using the adjusted address.
    The fix is to perform the adjustment only when codeinfo is not passed
    in.
