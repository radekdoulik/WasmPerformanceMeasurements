    Use Knobs to populate AppContext switches (#86883)
    
    Previously AppContext switches were set by injecting a method that calls `AppContext.SetSwitch` at startup. Use the configuration blob added in #86068 instead. This makes startup a tiny bit faster and the outputs a tiny bit smaller.
    
    Fixes #77054.
