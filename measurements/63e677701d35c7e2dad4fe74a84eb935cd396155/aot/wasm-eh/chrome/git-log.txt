    [mono] Update offsets-tool python clang binding so it works with newer clang (#86256)
    
    They introduced a breaking change to CursorKind.TRANSLATION_UNIT in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/bb83f8e70bd1d56152f02307adacd718cd67e312, which means we hit an issue when using the binding against a newer clang. Update the binding to the latest upstream and add a tweak so it still works with older clang versions.
