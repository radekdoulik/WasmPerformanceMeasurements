    Remove managed EH code frames from stack trace (#108723)
    
    When StackTrace is created inside of an exception filter, it contains
    stack frames of the managed exception handling code, like
    System.Runtime.EH.RhThrowEx
    System.Runtime.EH.DispatchEx
    System.Runtime.EH.FindFirstPassHandler
    
    These should not occur on the stack trace as they are internal
    implementation detail of the new EH.
    
    This change fixes it by adding [StackTraceHidden] attribute to these
    methods.
