    Allow the vector and scalar code paths for min, max, and fma APIs to share logic (#116804)
    
    * Allow the vector and scalar code paths for min/max APIs to share logic
    
    * Allow the vector and scalar code paths for fma APIs to share logic
    
    * Ensure max is handled for simdSize 32 and 64
    
    * Fix the riscv64 build
    
    * Ensure integer min/max magnitude is handled
    
    * Ensure the parameter ordering is correct
    
    * Apply formatting patch
    
    * Ensure that the remaining code paths execute when importing minMax intrinsics
    
    * Ensure we don't pop the args on platforms which aren't treating min/max as intrinsic
    
    * Responding to PR feedback
    
    * Check IsVectorNegativeZero using the node's simd base type
