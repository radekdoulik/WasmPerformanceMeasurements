    Implement IList<T> on some LINQ iterators (#88249)
    
    `ICollection<T>` provides both a Count and a CopyTo, and `IList<T>` an indexer, all of which can make various consumption mechanisms more efficient. We only implement the interfaces when the underlying collection has a fixed size and all of the interface implementations are side-effect free (in particular, while appealing to do so, we don't implement them on various Select iterators).
    
    Some of the serialization tests need to be fixed as a result. The state of Queue's array is a bit different based on how its initialized, and such private details show up in BinaryFormatter output.  Rather than special-casing the output per framework and core, I've just changed the test itself to ensure Queue can't see the size of the input collection.
