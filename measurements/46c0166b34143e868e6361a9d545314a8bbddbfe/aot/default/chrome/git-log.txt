    [RISC-V][LoongArch64] Pass FP struct fields at arbitrary offsets in ArgIterator and CallDescrWorker (#105800)
    
    * Add calls by reflection to tests
    
    * Adjust CallDescrWorker to support passing and returning structs according to floating-point calling convention fully
    
    * Adjust ArgIterator so C# and C++ versions match
    
    * Merge RISC-V and LoongArch ArgIterator implementations because our ABIs are nearly the same
    
    * Update LoongArch CallDescWorker assembly
    
    * Update ContainsPointers method name
    
    * Update tests by reflection
    
    * Missing asmconstants.h update for loongarch
    
    * Remove legacy StructFloatFieldInfoFlags
    
    * LoongArch typos
