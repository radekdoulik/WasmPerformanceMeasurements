    Improved the test coverage of XmlWriter. (#107680)
    
    * Replicated the test cases from TCWriteNode_XmlReader.cs for XPathNavigator.
    * Removed the test cases that did not make sense due to the simplified XPath model.
    * Enabled testing async methods of XmlWriter.
    
    Fixes #20428
