    [clr-interp] Add support for virtual method calls  (#114529)
    
    * [clr-interp] Add support for virtual calls (including interface)
    
    This follows a trivial approach where we resolve the MethodDesc of the target method by reusing existing functionality. Long term, virtual dispatching should go through slots continaing interpreter IR code pointer, in a similar fashion to JIT.
    
    * Add test for virtual method dispatch
    
    * Disable test for now
    
    No gc support yet
