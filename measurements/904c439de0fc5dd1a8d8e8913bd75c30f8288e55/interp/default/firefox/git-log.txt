    PlaceInterfaceMethod is now more optimized (#96703)
    
    * PlaceInterfaceMethod is now more optimized
    - It naturally has an O(N*M) algorithm, we reduce it to O(N*(Msmaller)), and make the constant factor faster
    - We take a local copy of the declared methods and name hashes, and the scan is now a straight linear scan of 32 bit memory DWORDS, and naturally skips nonpublic and non virtual methods.
