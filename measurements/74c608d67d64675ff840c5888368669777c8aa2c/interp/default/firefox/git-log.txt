    JIT: Add out-of-bounds fallback for AdvSimd.ShiftRightLogical (#105777)
    
    Fixes #105621. When its immediate is out-of-bounds, AdvSimd.ShiftRightLogical can be transformed into AdvSimd.ShiftLogical, which takes the immediate in a register. This means AdvSimd.ShiftRightLogical will no longer throw ArgumentOutOfRangeException in Debug or Release; when optimizing, we'd previously fold the intrinsic away, thus creating behavioral discrepancies.
