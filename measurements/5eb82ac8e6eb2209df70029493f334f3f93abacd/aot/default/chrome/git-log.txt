    Move Microsoft.NET.WebAssembly.WebCil into tasks (#89999)
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/89987
    
    Repo task projects need to reside under src/tasks as the
    TasksConfiguration property applies to these projects. By having a
    referenced task project outside of src/tasks, it's easy to get
    binclashes because of a project being built for different configurations
    (Debug vs Release).
