    Update PAL and GC `BitScanForward` to use `__builtin_clz` (#89350)
    
    The existing PAL code was using `__builtin_clzl` which is intended for platforms
    where `long` is 64 bits. Instead use `__builtin_clz`.
    
    The GC version had a similar issue so I've changed that too. The JIT version
    was already using `__builtin_clz`.
    
    Fixes #89340.
