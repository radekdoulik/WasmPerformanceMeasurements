    Generate custom attributes from metadata instead of type system (#100763)
    
    Fixes #100688
    
    Fixes a bit more than just what was reported (see the test). We were losing type information in `attribute.DecodeValue` and could no longer distinguish between `new object[] { SomeEnum.Val }` and `new SomeEnum[] { SomeEnum.Val }`.
    
    The fix required a complete rewrite of attribute emission using the more low level API.
