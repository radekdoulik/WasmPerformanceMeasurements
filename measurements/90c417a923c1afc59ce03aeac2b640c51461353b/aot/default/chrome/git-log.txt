    JIT: remove incorrect type deduction for an Unsafe.As case (#93694)
    
    Thanks to @SingleAccretion for the fix.
    
    The JIT was assuming that an indirectly accessed value type field had
    the type of the field, but that might not be the case if the field
    was accessed via `Unsafe.As`.
    
    Fix this by limiting type deduction from these indirectly accessed fields
    to only ref type fields.
    
    Closes #93650.
