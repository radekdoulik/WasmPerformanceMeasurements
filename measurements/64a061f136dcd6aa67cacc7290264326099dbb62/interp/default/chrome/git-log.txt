    JIT: more likelihood checking (#99541)
    
    Check has likelihood and likelihood sum consistency all the way until
    rationalize.
    
    Several phases required a bit of revision, notably the multi-guess type
    test expansion (similar to GDV) and optimize bools.
    
    Fix carry-over issue from previous round where block and edge scaling
    in loop cloning used different factors.
    
    Contributes to #93020
