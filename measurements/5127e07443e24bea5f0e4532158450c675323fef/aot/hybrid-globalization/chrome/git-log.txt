    JIT: cross-block local assertion prop in morph (#94363)
    
    During global morph, allow assertions to propagate to a block from the block's
    predecessors. Handle special cases where we can't allow this to happen:
    * block has preds that have not yet been morphed
    * block has no preds
    * block is specially flagged as one that might gain new preds during morph
    * block is an EH handler entry
    
    Contributes to #93246.
    
    When enabled, size the assertion table based on the number of locals, up to the tracked limit.
    
    Disabled by default; use 'DOTNET_JitEnableCrossBlockLocalAssertionProp=1` to enable.
