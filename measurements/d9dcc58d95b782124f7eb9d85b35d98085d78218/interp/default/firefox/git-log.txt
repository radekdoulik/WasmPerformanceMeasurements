    Remove more `ASG` terminlogy from the codebase (#86760)
    
    * Excise 'assignment' terminology from the codebase
    
    * Standardize on the 'value' terminology for store operands
    
    But only in the frontend; backend has lots of "data"s, and it did not seem purposeful renaming them.
