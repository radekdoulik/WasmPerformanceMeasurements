    Workaround broken special APC when running x64 on arm64 windows (#102333)
    
    * Workaround broken special APC when running x64 on arm64 windows
    
    In ARM64 windows older than 24H2, the special APC is broken when running
    x64 emulation. The callback that gets invoked doesn't get an argument
    with correct CONTEXT of the interrupted location. This change disables
    using the special APC for runtime suspension when running on the
    affected Windows versions.
    
    Close #100425
    
    * Make the same fix for NativeAOT
