    Address feedback and fix some TensorPrimitives issues (#92395)
    
    * Address feedback and fix some TensorPrimitives issues
    
    - Added a few APIs based on initial feedback: Abs (vectorized), Log2, and element-wise Max/Min{Magnitude}
    - Renamed L2Normalize to Norm
    - Fixed semantics of Min/MaxMagnitude to return original value rather than the absolute value
    - Renamed a few helper types for consistency
    - Added tests
    
    * Add a few more uses of Tolerance
