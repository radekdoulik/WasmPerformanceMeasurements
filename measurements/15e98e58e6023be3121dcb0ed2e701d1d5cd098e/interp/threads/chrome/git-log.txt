    JIT: Mark swift error as busy before call definition RefPosition (#101792)
    
    The RefPosition we were inserting here was inserted too late to actually
    protect the call definition from being allocated into the error
    register.
    
    Instead, we can just mark the existing `RefTypeFixedReg` created for the
    argument use as delay freed, which will have the intended effect of
    keeping the error register busy until after the call definition.
