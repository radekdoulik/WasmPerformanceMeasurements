    Set of interpreter related fixes for coreclr tests (#118617)
    
    * Set of interpreter related fixes for coreclr tests
    
    The changes in this PR were made to fix various issues uncovered by the
    coreclr tests.
    * Handle case when a try block is eliminated because it can never be
      executed.
    * Ensure call stubs are generated for IL stubs.
    * Fix shadow stack updating during stack walk
    * Fix handling managed exceptions thrown as SEH from managed code called
      by JIT / Interpreter compiler in interpreted code.
    * Fix resuming after catch in interpreted code for cases when
      interpreted code calls another interpreted code via a prestub, which
      currently happens for delegates.
    * Ensure that ip is saved to the pFrame->ip before calling native
      methods that can throw to make sure that the stack walk reports
      correct return IP.
    
    * Fix build break
    
    * One more build break
    
    * Fix WASM build break
