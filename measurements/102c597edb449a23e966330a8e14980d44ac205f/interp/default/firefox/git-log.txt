    Add trimming intrinsic for EventInfo.EventHandlerType.GetMethod("Invoke") (#116931)
    
    Because ILLink and ILC keep the `Invoke` method on delegates, there
    shouldn't be a warning for the common pattern of
    `EventInfo.EventHandlerType.GetMethod("Invoke")`.
    
    It's possible to break this logic by using a custom `EventInfo`, but
    we don't support the scenario where this breaks the contract that
    `EventHandlerType` should be a delegate.
