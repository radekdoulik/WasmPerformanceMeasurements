    Avoid package dependencies on libraries in the shared framework (#106172)
    
    * Avoid package dependencies on libraries in the shared framework
    
    We can avoid these dependencies since we can count on the library being
    part of the shared framework.  Fewer dependencies means less packages
    downloaded, less for customers to service, less copied into the output
    directory when serviced.
    
    * Add warning code.
    
    * Address feedback
