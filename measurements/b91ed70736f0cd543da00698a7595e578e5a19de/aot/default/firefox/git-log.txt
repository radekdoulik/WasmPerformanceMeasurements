    Speed up cmake configure on Mono Windows build. (#97303)
    
    cmake checks on Windows (espacially with MSBuild) are very slow,
    minutes of additional time per configuration is spend running checks.
    
    Windows headers already overrides checks and since
    majority of header/function checks are not applicable on Windows this
    commit stops running all these checks and instead add needed
    header defines explicit for Windows. Dramatically improve build times
    off Windows Mono runtime and cross compiler.
