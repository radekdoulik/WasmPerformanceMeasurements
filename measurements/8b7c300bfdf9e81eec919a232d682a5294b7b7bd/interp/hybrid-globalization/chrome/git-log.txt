    Fix DependencyContext splitting on semi-colon (#87518)
    
    * Fix DependencyContext splitting on semi-colon
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/5e67657e20665c32c2bd5c4ac1c8b1af78c9677e introduced a bug in DependencyContextPaths where the static array is not initialized before it is being used in the Create static method.
    
    This fix removes the static array since it is only used once.
    
    - Don't cache the semicolon array since it is only used once at startup
    - Skip test on netfx since it doesn't work.
