    JIT: Don't move EH region entries when aligning backward jumps (#110918)
    
    Follow-up to #110277. Fixes #110756. Don't consider 4-opt cut points that would move the entry block of a try/handler region below other blocks in the region. Previously, either future moves would put the entry block back at the top of the region, or we would get unlucky in the rare case and hit asserts.
