    Expanded & clarified BerConverter tests (#98676)
    
    * Documented decoding tests, added several new ones
    
    This should demonstrate how to properly decode using the "v" format string
    
    * Added new test to demonstrate differing Encode/Decode behaviour
    
    ber_printf will always write a series of octet strings if passed a string[] with the "v" or "V" format strings. ber_scanf expects an ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF octet strings.
    
    * Moved additional test to Windows-only, adjusted expected return value
    
    The latter doesn't match my computer, but the difference appears to be coming from within the underlying ber_scanf library so I can't investigate further.
