    [workloads] Don't load mono librarymode targets if PublishAot is set (#103777)
    
    This change removes the incorrect error message when you using NativeAOT library mode
    on mobile and you have `<NativeLib>` set. Previously, it would only detect if `<NativeLib>` was
    set and error out if you didn't install the library builder workload. That only applies if mono
    is your target.
