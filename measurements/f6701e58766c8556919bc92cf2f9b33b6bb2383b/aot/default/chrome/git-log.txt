    [cdac] Implement GetThreadStoreData in cDAC (#102404)
    
    - Implement `GetThreadStoreData` and `GetThreadCounts` in `Thread` contract
    - Finish implementing `ISOSDacInterface::GetThreadStoreData` in cDAC
      - Add specific threads (first in thread store, Finalizer, GC) and counts
    - Make existing DAC call into cDAC for `GetThreadData` if available
      - Only fills out managed thread ID and next thread right now - always returns E_NOTIMPL
    - Update the example C# API in docs to be closer to what we have now
