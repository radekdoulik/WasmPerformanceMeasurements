    Convert the Remaining Legacy Tests to the Merged Wrapper Model (#98469)
    
    * Did StartupHook conversion but it doesn't generate any output :(
    
    * Ported NativeAot ComWrappers Smoke Tests.
    
    * Converted the majority of nativeaot tests to the new system. Not tested yet though.
    
    * Fixed the individual nativeaot compilation errors, but it still
    doesn't build. It can't generate the runner file for some reason.
    
    * Disabled MultiModule tests to check actual progress, and it builds now!
    
    * DRAFT: Fixed the args build problem in DynamicGenerics test.
    
    * DRAFT: Saving my progress.
    
    * Ported the Managed test tree to the MergedWrapperSystem.
    
    * DRAFT: Delete the 'sizeondisk' subtree because it is no longer used.
    
    * Fixed the remaining NativeAOT ported tests.
    
    * Restored the MultiModule tests to the legacy system because it's not
    feasible to migrate them, at least for the time being.
    
    * Reenabled missing call to `Generics.Run()` in the Determinism tests.
    
    * Addressed comments from Jeremy.
