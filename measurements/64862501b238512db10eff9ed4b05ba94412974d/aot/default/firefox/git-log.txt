    [mono][jit] Fuse SIMD extract and insert on arm64 (#92714)
    
    * Fuse extract and insert into arm64 ins.
    
    * Extending to vector4.
    
    * Ins index is now a function. Removed newline.
    
    * Refactoring.
    
    * SIMD extract ops have no side offects (to facilitate their elimination). Fixed bug.
    
    * Fixed arm32 build.
