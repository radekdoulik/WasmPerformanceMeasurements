    Fix AOT warning in System.Linq.Expressions (#109758)
    
    The UnconditionalSuppressMessage didn't work correctly because
    it wasn't targeting the static constructor. We don't need to suppress
    this warning - we can just bubble it up because it looks like all references
    to CallSiteOpsReflectionCache<T> are already annotated with
    RequiresDynamicCode.
