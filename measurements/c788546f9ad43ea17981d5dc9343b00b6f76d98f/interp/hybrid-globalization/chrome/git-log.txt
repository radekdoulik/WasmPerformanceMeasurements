    Report exports as control flow guard targets (#106320)
    
    Fixes #105330 - see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/105330#issuecomment-2286235501 for more context. While link.exe should make sure entrypoints exported from a DLL are valid CFG targets, this doesn't happen for native AOT object files.
