    [cdac] Implement `IXCLRDataProcess::GetTaskByOSThreadID` (#109230)
    
    - Add `ClrDataTask` to cDAC as its implementation of `IXCLRDataTask`
      - Currently delegates everything to legacy implementation
    - Implement `IXCLRDataProcess::GetTaskByOSThreadID`
      - Uses `Thread` contract to find the address of the thread corresponding to the specified OS thread ID.
      - Gets the result from the legacy DAC and passes it to the cDAC `ClrDataTask`
    - Add tests for `Thread` contract
