    Split FeatureSwitchManager (#97626)
    
    I had this refactor in a branch I ended up not using. The refactor itself is a good change.
    
    `FeatureSwitchManager` does two things:
    
    * Read and parse ILLink substitutions on a per-assembly basis as needed
    * Actually substitute the IL
    
    The responsibilities are pretty cleanly separated, so put these in different classes and files. It's possible we'll eventually get rid of the one that substitutes IL if/when RyuJIT becomes the scanner.
