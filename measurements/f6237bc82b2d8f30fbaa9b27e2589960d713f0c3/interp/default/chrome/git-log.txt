    Special casing `System.Guid` for COM VARIANT marshalling (#100377)
    
    * Support System.Guid marshalling via VARIANT
    
    VARIANT marshalling in .NET 5+ requires a TLB
    for COM records (i.e., ValueType instances). This
    means that without a runtime provided TLB, users
    must define their own TLB for runtime types or
    define their own transfer types.
    
    We address this here by deferring to the NetFX
    mscorlib's TLB.
