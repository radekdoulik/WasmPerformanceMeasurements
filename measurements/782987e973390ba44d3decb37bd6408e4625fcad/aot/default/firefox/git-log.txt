    [workload-testing] Misc improvements (#99392)
    
    * [workload-testing] Use `PackageDownload` instead of `PackageReference`
    
    .. to get manifest, and workload pack nugets. The task does not need
    these to be references as it essentially just copies files from the
    restored location to the sdk. But using `PackageDownload` allows
    packages with `PackageType=DotnetPlatform` to work too, which is most
    manifest nugets.
    
    * [workload-testing] Add property for output of workload-install command
    
    * Add support for emitting packageSourceMappings in nuget.config, which is useful when using Central Package Management
    
    * cleanup
    
    * [workload-testing] Add PackageSourceNameForBuiltPackages property that defaults to nuget-local
    
    * Extract the nuget.config patch method into a separate task
    
    `PatchNuGetConfig`
    
    This would be useful in generating similar files for running tests.
    
    * fix trimmer tests build
    
    * Update src/mono/nuget/Microsoft.NET.Runtime.WorkloadTesting.Internal/README.md
