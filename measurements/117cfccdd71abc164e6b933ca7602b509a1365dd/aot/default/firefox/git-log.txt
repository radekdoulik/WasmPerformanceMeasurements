    Create portable box helper and wrap the thread-local alloc context in a struct (#103607)
    
    * Create a portable box helper and remove the assembly-based one. The codegen is close, but we don't need to be exact as most box operations are inlined anyway
    
    * Create a new struct we can put GC-focused thread-locals on (like GC mode, frame/gc frame chains, etc)
    
    * Update jithelpers.cpp
