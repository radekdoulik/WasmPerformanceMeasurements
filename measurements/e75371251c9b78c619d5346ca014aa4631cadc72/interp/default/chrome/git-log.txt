    Allow trimming FeatureGuard and FeatureSwitchDefinition attributes (#100263)
    
    Under AggressiveAttributeTrimming setting.
    
    Fixes
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/100256. AggressiveAttributeTrimming
    was attempting to remove RequiresDynamicCode attributes, but the
    type was still referenced by FeatureGuardAttribute on
    IsDynamicCodeCompiled.
    
    Adding FeatureGuardAttribute to the set of attributes that get
    removed with AggressiveAttributeTrimming fixes this. Also adding
    FeatureSwitchDefinitionAttribute because that one can be removed
    as well.
