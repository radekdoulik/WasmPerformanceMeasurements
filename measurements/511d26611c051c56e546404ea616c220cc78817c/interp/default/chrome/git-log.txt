    Warn on method access in Requires analyzers (#110086)
    
    The issue with calling Methods with requires is the the method itself,
    not the parameters. Warning on the entire invocation including the
    parameters can be confusing. Instead, we should warn just on the method
    access for Requires. DynamicallyAccessedMembers should still warn on the
    invocation.
    
    Also updates the Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration diagnostic suppressor to work suppress warnings on the method access, not only on method invocation warnings.
