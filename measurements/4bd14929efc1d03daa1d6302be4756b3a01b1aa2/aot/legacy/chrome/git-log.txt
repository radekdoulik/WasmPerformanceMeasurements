    Make Config generator test only for down-casts (#106145)
    
    * Make Config generator test for downcasts
    
    We were hitting compiler errors when the generator emitted test casts
    for value types.  Since those can never be true (value types cannot be
    derived from, and the compiler can see if the cast will succeed or not).
    
    Fix this by only doing a test cast when we are trying to do a runtime
    downcast.
    
    * Rename ShouldTestCast -> ShouldTryCast
    
    * Add tests for readonly collection structs
    
    These are unsupported and ignored by the generator and a diagnostic is
    emitted.
    
    Binding data to them does nothing.
