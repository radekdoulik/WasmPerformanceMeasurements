    JIT: Clean up `FlowGraphDominatorTree::Build` (#103803)
    
    We guarantee that `fgFirstBB` dominates all reachable basic blocks, so
    `IntersectDom` is never going to end up seeing a `nullptr`. Also, if the
    DFS tree does not have cycles the algorithm will converge in one
    iteration, so there is no reason to run a second one to notice no
    changes.
