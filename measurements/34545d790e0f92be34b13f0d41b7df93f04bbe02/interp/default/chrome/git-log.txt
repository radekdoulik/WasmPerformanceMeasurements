    JIT: don't mark callees noinline for non-fatal observations with pgo (#114821)
    
    Some inline policy decisions are sensitive to the root method having valid
    PGO data.  And sometimes the decision is that a particular callee can never
    be a viable inline.  If so, the policy will have the runtime mark the method
    as `NoInlining` to short-circuit future inlining decisions and save some JIT
    throughput.
    
    But if the method had valid PGO data the policy may have made a different
    decision. By marking this method noinline, the JIT will immediately reject
    all future inline attempts (say from other calling methods with valid PGO data).
    
    For instance, without PGO, the policy may limit the number of basic blocks in
    a viable callee to 5. But with PGO the policy is willing to consider callees
    with many more blocks.
    
    In this PR we modify the reporting policy so that if TieredPGO is active,
    we only ever report back methods with truly fatal inlining issues, not just
    "informational" or "performance" issues, regardless of the state of the
    PGO data for the method being jitted.
