    Adding vectorized implementations of Exp to Vector64/128/256/512 (#97114)
    
    * Adding vectorized implementations of Exp to Vector64/128/256/512
    
    * Accelerate TensorPrimitives.Exp for double
    
    * Ensure the right allowedVariance is used for the vectorized exp tests
    
    * Ensure V128/256/512 defers to the next smaller vector size by operating on the lower/upper halves
    
    * Ensure the right allowedVariance amounts are used for the vectorized Exp(float) tests
    
    * Ensure we call Exp and that the methods are properly inlined
    
    * Skip the Exp test for Vector128/256/512 on Mono due to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/97176
