    Add regression test for assembly origin for event marking (#102836)
    
    Adds a regression test for the issue that was fixed in #102613.
    
    The assembly level attribute marks the members on the referenced type, and the assembly is the MessageOrigin for the marking.
    
    I confirmed this fails with before #102613.
