    Don't run net4x tests with Mono on non-Windows (#98767)
    
    * Don't run net4x tests with Mono on non-Windows
    
    We'd try to use Mono to run them but most of the tests assume Windows when targetting net4x so they don't work anyway and you'd need to remember to pass the `-f net9.0` TFM filter.
    Instead just skip them on non-Windows platforms.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/81395
    
    * Make AdditionalProperties more resilient against changes
    
    * Use TargetOS instead of OS so it also works for building e.g. Browser targets on Windows
    
    * Move logic to arcade Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks
    
    * Update eng/testing/outerBuild.targets
