    JIT: Expose top-level address computations in local morph (#106065)
    
    Physical promotion relies on the invariant that we see no `LCL_ADDR`
    nodes for unexposed locals (except for retbuf definitions). However,
    local morph would not expose top level address computations with a note
    that morph would get rid of it.
    
    We could extract side effects for this case, but it does not seem
    frequent enough to warrant the special behavior.
