    Put `LogExceptionThrown` on the `NativeRuntimeEventSource` plan (#118729)
    
    This unifies `LogExceptionThrown` with the other eventing that is implemented in the native runtime (threads/threadpool).
    
    Noticed this in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/107418#issuecomment-3187925557 where we run an awful lot of code in situations where event source is not even enabled.
