    [mono] Fix class initialization spurious wakeups (#96903)
    
    * mono_runtime_class_init_full: handle spurious wakeups
    
    the condition variable may be signaled even if the initialization by
    the other thread is not done yet.  Handle spurious wakeups the same
    way as timeouts: go around once more from the beginning.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96872 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96804
    
    * fix unbalanced handle frames
    
    if we goto retry_top, don't set up a new handle frame that lacks a
    matching HANDLE_FUNCTION_RETURN_VAL.
    
    Instead setup the handle frame once upfront
