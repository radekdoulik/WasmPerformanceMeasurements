    Stop using LocalizationResources within framework (#86430)
    
    Fixes #81459.
    
    I moved the messages to `EventAttribute.Message` which I believe should be equivalent, but I would appreciate if someone could double-check.
    I also removed all the now-unused resource strings. I believe they all need to be prefixed by one of well-known prefixes. I would appreciate if someone could double-check.
