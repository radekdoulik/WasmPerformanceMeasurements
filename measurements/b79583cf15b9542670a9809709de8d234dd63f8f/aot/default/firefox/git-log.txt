    JIT: Properly handle param reg targets with multiple register assignments (#113499)
    
    LSRA can assign different registers to the same local over its lifetime.
    When this happens for a parameter, there is special logic to ensure that
    the parameter gets its right initial register assignment. This handling
    was missing for mapped parameter register targets.
