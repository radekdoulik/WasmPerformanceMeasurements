    [cdac] Add basic cdacreader project (#100623)
    
    This change adds a basic `cdacreader` project under src/native/managed.
    - Built as part of the clr subset (via runtime-prereqs referencing compile-native.proj)
    - Not yet integrated into anything in the product (that is, the dac doesn't try to use it yet)
    - Can return a class that can implement the ISOSDacInterface* interfaces - currently does ISOSDacInterface9
