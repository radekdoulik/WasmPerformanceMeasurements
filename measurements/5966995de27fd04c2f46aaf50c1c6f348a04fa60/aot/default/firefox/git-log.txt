    Remove setting `$ORIGIN/netcoredeps` rpath (#114512)
    
    The original use case for setting the RPATH was self-contained Linux apps.
    
    Some time between .NET 6 and .NET 8, we started using a newer linker, such that this setting sets RUNPATH instead of RPATH. This meant it only applied to the host executable, not the runtime libraries (like coreclr).
    
    The netcoredeps behaviour was from a time when our dependencies were more complicated and even its intended use case has no support story.
