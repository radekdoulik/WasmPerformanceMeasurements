    Implement ldtoken in the interpreter (#115723)
    
    * Implements a new LDTOKEN interpreter opcode with support for method/field/type tokens. Only type tokens have been tested, it's not currently possible to test the other two.
    * Adds an integrity check header to InterpMethod because the behavior if we jump to something that isn't a valid InterpMethod is very messy and harder to debug.
    * Fixes a bug in the CallStub generator for sysv (we weren't handling certain argument types.)
