    Fix incorrect handle type count when FEATURE_SIZED_REF_HANDLES is not defined (#107433)
    
    Regression from https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/107326 - without `FEATURE_SIZED_REF_HANDLES` defined, this was incorrectly passing an array of two handle types - HNDTYPE_STRONG and HNDTYPE_WEAK_SHORT (0) - when promoting objects pointed to by strong handles.
