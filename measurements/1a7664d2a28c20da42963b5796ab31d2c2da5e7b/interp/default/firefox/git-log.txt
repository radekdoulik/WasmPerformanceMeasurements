    Fix unhandled exception test for composite r2r case (#109244)
    
    The test fails when built as r2r composite on linux coreclr due to the fact that the
    unhandled exception differs in this case from regular non-composite or non-r2r builds.
    It gets System.EntryPointNotFoundException instead of System.DllNotFoundException due
    to a different order the resolving happens in this case.
    
    This change fixes that by modifying the unhandledTester to accept both of these
    cases as success.
