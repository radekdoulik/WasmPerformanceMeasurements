    Disable new warnings introduced with clang 18 (#99811)
    
    clang 18 introduces `-Wswitch-default`, which requires that every switch
    must have a `default` branch. We can add missing `default` in switches,
    but the other option `-Wcovered-switch-default` complains if all the
    cases in a switch are exhaustive and `default` doesn't do anything. So
    disable one of these mutually exclusive warnings.
    
    We will also need to merge in the changes from
    https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/14572 to actually try and use
    clang-18/clang++-18.
