    Simplify handling of multi-reg returns (#74499)
    
    * Simplify handling of return ABI info
    
    Add the return type descriptor to compiler and use it.
    
    Delete target-specific code from "impFixupStructReturnType".
    
    The main target of this change is getting rid of the dependency
    of multi-reg RETURN backend code on exact struct handles on temps
    it expects as the sources.
    
    * Work around diffs on ARM
    
    Due to the buggy nature of the old code, the matrix for what
    substititions were allowed was as follows:
    
           ARM         x86
    LONG   not-LCL_VAR NONE
    STRUCT LCL_VAR     LCL_VAR
    
    This commit preserves this extremely quirky behavior.
    
    Unfortunately, just enabling the propagation is a CQ regression
    due to some RA issues.
