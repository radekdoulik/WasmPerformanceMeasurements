    * Fix a case in MethodImpl overriding which wasn't handled as expected in ilc.exe for native aot
    - This was causing real C# applications to fail to behave correctly on NativeAOT builds
    - Enable testing for covariant byref returns on nativeaot (split testing up so that the tests do not expect TypeLoadException, which NativeAOT doesn't reliably generate)
    - Put copy of attributetesting.il test into the managed type system unit test suite
    - Add regression test of issue noted in #96175 into managed type system unit test suite
    - Update workflow documentation to include a better path to finding details on how to run CoreCLR and Libraries tests for Native AOT
    
    Fixes #96175
