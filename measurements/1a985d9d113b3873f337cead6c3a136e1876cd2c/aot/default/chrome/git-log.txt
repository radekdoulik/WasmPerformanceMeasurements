    [NativeAOT] 32-bit platform ObjWriter and bit rot fixes (#96890)
    
    * Use PC-relative relocations for ARMEmitter.EmitMOV(dest, symbol)
    
    * Fix handling of signed offsets in IMAGE_REL_BASED_THUMB_BRANCH24 calculations
    
    * Generate position independent code in NativeAOT on linux-arm
    
    * Handle ARM32 in DwarfCie
    
    * Fix relocations emitted in 32-bit ELF for x86/arm32; apply correct addends to account for R2R ABI differences; use inline addend for 32-bit platforms; mark function symbols as Thumb code on ARM
    
    * ELF/ARM32: Emit thumb mapping symbols for executable sections
    
    * Try to revert ARMEmitter.EmitMOV
    
    * Convert IMAGE_REL_BASED_THUMB_MOV32_PCREL to ELF with the same offset as R2R
    
    * Unoptimal, but working, version of INLINE_GET_TLS_VAR for ARM32
    
    * Use PC-relative relocations for ARMEmitter.EmitMOV(dest, symbol)
    
    * Fat function pointers are not function symbols as far as ELF is concerned; the should not get the symbol size or the Thumb bit
    
    * Fix some bits and pieces of the ARM unwinding code
    
    * Don't try to use ObjWriter package on unsupported platforms
    
    * Generate valid ARM32 DWARF unwind info in JIT
    
    * Handle negative offsets in CFI_REL_OFFSET conversion (unused at the moment)
    
    * Add linux-arm support to cross-compile targets
    
    * Update src/coreclr/nativeaot/Runtime/unix/unixasmmacrosarm.inc

    * Fix the order of register push in CFI unwind codes on ARM.
    
    * Make jit-format happy without making the code look ugly
