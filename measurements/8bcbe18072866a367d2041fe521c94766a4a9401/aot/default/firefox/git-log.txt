    Unify debug views of immutable dictionaries (#100745)
    
    * Unify debug views of immutable dictionaries
    
    Fixes #94289
    
    - Updates the way the debugger displays the remaining dictionaries (Frozen, Immutable, ImmutableSorted, Concurrent) to present their keys and values in separate columns.
    - Fixes debugger views of Builder classes of immutable collections. Previous custom implementations incorrectly treated the Builder classes as immutable.
    
    * Fixed tests of debugger attributes with immutable and concurrent generic dictionaries
    
    * Removed tests superseded by DebugView.Tests.
    * Fixed DebugView.Tests of cuncurrent and immutable generic dictionaries which failed on .Net Framework
    
    * Fix ns2.0 build.
