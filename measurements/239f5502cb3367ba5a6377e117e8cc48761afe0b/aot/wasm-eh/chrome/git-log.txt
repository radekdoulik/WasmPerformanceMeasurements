    Fix RegexOptions.NonBacktracking matching end anchors at timeout check boundaries (#74525)
    
    Pass integer bound into innermost matching loop rather than slicing the input
    span, which was causing end anchors to improperly match before input end.
    Add test that fails when timeout check boundaries get treated as end-of-input.
