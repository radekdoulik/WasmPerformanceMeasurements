    Fix infinite timeout passed to CancellationTokenSource.CancelAfter (#84009)
    
    The recent change to introduce ITimer broke CTS.CancelAfter(Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan).  The TimeSpan's milliseconds were extracted as a uint but then ended up being cast to a long, such that rather than representing -1 milliseconds, it represented 4294967295 milliseconds.  With the uint representation in Timer, Timeout.UnsignedInfinite needs to be special-cased.
