    Stop using LINQ in Tensors (#109415)
    
    Using `IEnumerable<T>` and associated LINQ extensions for numerical processing is not appropriate at this level of the stack. The only remaining use is where the input provided by the user is already an `IEnumerable<T>` and `ToArray` is used to get the required `T[]`, which is fine.
