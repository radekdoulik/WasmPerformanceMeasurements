    Share threadpool configuration (#110469)
    
    Threadpool can be configured using AppContext switches or environment variables. The environment variable configuration uses a roundabout mechanism that makes it CoreCLR specific. Move the configuration to managed code that is shared with all runtimes.
    
    This should have equivalent behavior in less than half the lines of code unless I'm missing something.
