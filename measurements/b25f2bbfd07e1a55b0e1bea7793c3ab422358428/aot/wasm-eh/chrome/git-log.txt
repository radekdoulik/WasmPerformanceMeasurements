    Switch RhConfig from TCHAR to char (#86393)
    
    - Hide away the details of reading the environment variable as `wchar` vs `char`
    - Keep embedded variables as as ASCII (they are embedded as such already)
    - Stop using `TCHAR` for the `RhConfig` APIs, which seemed to just be more confusing to consume
