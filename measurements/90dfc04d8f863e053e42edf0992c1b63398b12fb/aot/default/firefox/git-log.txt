    [cdac] Handle non-IL method descs in `RuntimeTypeSystem_1.GetMethodClassificationDataType` (#110602)
    
    - Add the different method desc types to the data descriptor
      - We only need their size right now
    - Add tests for different method desc classifications
      - Mostly fill-in for things I found we didn't cover - `GetNativeCode_StableEntryPoint_NonVtableSlot` is the one that actually hits the updated code in this change
