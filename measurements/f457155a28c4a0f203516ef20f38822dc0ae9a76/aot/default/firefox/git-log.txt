    Add project to create helix work items for host tests (#108529)
    
    - Add `src/installer/tests/helixpublish.proj`
      - Defines correlation payloads (pre-built test targets, .NET install layout, product host binaries, test/mock host binaries)
      - Sets pre-commands to set environment variables used by tests for test assets and artifacts locations
      - Generate helix work items for each host test project - runs `dotnet test <host_test_dll>` for each test with the built output as the payload directory
    - Update `RepoDirectoryProvider` to use `HELIX_CORRELATION_PAYLOAD` (when available) for path to product/test host binaries.
    
    This is not hooked up to actually run in a pipeline. I tested by manually kicking off runs by setting environment variables and directly building the new project. For example:
    - `dotnet build src\installer\tests\helixpublish.proj -c Release /t:Test /p:Creator=dev /p:HelixTargetQueues=Windows.Amd64.Server2022.Open`
    - `dotnet build ./src/installer/tests/helixpublish.proj -c Release /t:Test /p:Creator=dev /p:HelixTargetQueues=Ubuntu.2204.Amd64.Open`
