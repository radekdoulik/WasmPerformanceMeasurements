    Update Enumerable.Range to support Vector<int>.Count <= 16 (#97464)
    
    `Vector<T>` is being updated to support 512-bit vectors. Update Enumerable.Range to support it as well. In the future hopefully this can be replaced by a method that'll just do the "right thing" regardless of vector size.
