    Fix CET - remove writing to shadow stack (#103171)
    
    In my recent fix for failures with CET enabled, I have also added a call to
    the _wrssq intrinsic to push an address to shadow stack. It turns out
    that instruction is privileged and cannot be used by user code.
    Moreover, I have realized that it is not needed at all there, so I am
    removing it.
