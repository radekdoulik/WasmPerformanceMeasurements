    Initialize m_fInPlaceSS (#109008)
    
    A recent fix added a new field to the DebuggerPatchSkip object and missed initializing it false. This causes the new in-place patch skipping logic activate at random depending on the value of uninitialized memory. Fixing this by initializing the variable.
