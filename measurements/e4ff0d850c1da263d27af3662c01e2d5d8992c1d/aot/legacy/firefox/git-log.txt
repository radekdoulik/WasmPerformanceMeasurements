    Remove string.Trim{,Start,End}(ReadOnlySpan<char>)
    
    These three methods have a higher overload resolution priority than any potential
    user defined extension methods `TrimEnd(this string, string)` (et al), but invariably
    yield a different answer than those extension methods: for an existing call
    `text.TrimEnd("suffix")` the extension method wants to remove just the suffix, so
    "prefixinfixsuffix" becomes "prefixinfix".  However, our method treats it as a call
    of `text.TrimEnd('s', 'u', 'f', 'f', 'i', 'x')`, yielding the result "prefixin".
    
    An alternative solution to this problem would be to define our own
    `string.TrimEnd(string)` instance method, but that has its own set of
    complications and is too risky to consider for backporting into .NET 9.
    
    This change only removes the methods from the System.Runtime (ref) assembly,
    in order to work better with the slightly circular dependency/flow in the dotnet/*
    repositories.
