    JIT: Encode SIMD base type in VN for all HW intrinsics (#105869)
    
    This changes the VN funcs for all HW intrinsic functions to always have an extra
    parameter for the SIMD base type. Before this change it was based on the
    instruction list, however that is not always the right thing (e.g. #105721 is a
    bug because of that). We also kept it as part of the HW intrinsic table, but
    that requires manual maintenance and is easy to get wrong. Always encoding the
    type is much more simple and the diffs do not look too bad.
    
    In .NET 10 we can decide if we want to opt some intrinsics into not being
    differentiated based on the SIMD base type. The easiest thing might be to always
    map those to have the same base SIMD type (e.g. `CORINFO_TYPE_BYTE`) so that we
    don't end up with differences in arities for some VN functions that are hard to
    reason about.
    
    Fix #105721
