    Report `RhpInitialDynamicInterfaceDispatch` reference in gfids (#103948)
    
    Some subset of tests is failing with control flow guard enabled because we're not able to indirectly call `RhpInitialDynamicInterfaceDispatch`. It's not clear why since we address take this method in C++ source files as well, but we should be reporting this from our object file too and doing that fixes it.
