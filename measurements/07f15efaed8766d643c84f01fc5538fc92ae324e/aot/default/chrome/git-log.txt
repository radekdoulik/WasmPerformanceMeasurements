    JIT: Stop calling morph from CSE (#106695)
    
    CSE cannot tolerate morph removing any defs, which many of morphs
    transformations can do. We have been slowly infecting morph with more
    and more checks to avoid this, but in reality CSE just should not
    reinvoke morph -- the benefits of doing this are minimal.
