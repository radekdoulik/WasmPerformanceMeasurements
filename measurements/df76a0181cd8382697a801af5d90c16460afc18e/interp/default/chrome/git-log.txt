    Enable NuGet Audit and fix issues (#107639)
    
    * Enable NuGet Audit and fix issues
    
    Microsoft.NET.HostModel can reference the live builds of the packages
    it depends on.  These will be deployed by the SDK.
    Most other audit alerts were due to tasks pulling in old dependencies
    that aren't even used by the task. Avoid these by cherry-picking
    just the assemblies needed by the tasks and provided by MSBuild / SDK.
    This prevents NuGet from downloading the package closure with the
    vulnerable packages.  We don't need those packages since the tasks
    aren't responsible for deploying them.  A better solution in the future
    would be a targeting pack for MSBuild and the .NET SDK - so that
    components that contribute to these hosts have a surface area they can
    target without taking on responsibility for servicing.
    
    There is once case where we have a test that references NuGet.* packages
    which also bring in stale dependencies that overlap with framework
    assemblies.  Avoid these by cherry-picking the NuGet packages in the
    same way.
    
    * Fix package path on linux
    
    * Only use live JSON from HostModel
    
    SDK pins S.R.M and a few others, so don't make them upgrade yet.
    
    * Add a couple missing assembly references
    
    * Refactor tasks dependencies
    
    Consolidate representation of msbuild-provided task dependencies
    
    * Fix audit warnings in tests
    
    * Remove MetadataLoadContext from WasmAppBuilder package
    
    * Update Analyzer.Testing packages
    
    * Reduce exposure of Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core
    
    * Fix audit warnings that only occur on browser
    
    * Update Asn1 used by linker analyzer tests
    
    * React to breaking change in analyzer test SDK
    
    * Enable working DryIoc tests
    
    * Fix double-write when LibrariesConfiguration differs from Configuration
    
    * Fix LibrariesConfiguration update target
    
    * Clean up references and add comments.
    
    * Make HostModel references private
    
    This ensures projects referenced will not be rebuilt by tests.
    
    This also means the HostModel package will not list these as references,
    but that's OK since the SDK provides them and this is not a shipping
    package.
    
    * Use ProjectReferenceExclusion to avoid framework project references
    
    On .NETCore we want to use the targeting pack and avoid rebuilding libs.
    
    * Update src/libraries/System.Runtime.InteropServices.JavaScript/tests/JSImportGenerator.UnitTest/JSImportGenerator.Unit.Tests.csproj
