    Fix filtering of FORTIFY_SOURCE flags (#119719)
    
    On Fedora and RHEL, when building the VMR (and runtime) we provide
    additional CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS to the build, including this set:
    
        -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS
    
    This is filtered incorrectly in eng/native/configureplatform.cmake,
    resulting in this CFLAG:
    
        -Wp,-Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS
    
    This is invalid and makes the build fail.
