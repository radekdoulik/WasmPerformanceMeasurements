    Make `DomainAssembly` create its `Assembly` in its constructor and remove separate allocate load level (#107224)
    
    There is no logical distinction between creating a `DomainAssembly` and an `Assembly` now. Making `DomainAssembly` create the `Assembly` as soon as it is constructed should make it so that we can switch assorted things that currently store/use `DomainAssembly` to `Assembly`, since they will be created at the same time.
