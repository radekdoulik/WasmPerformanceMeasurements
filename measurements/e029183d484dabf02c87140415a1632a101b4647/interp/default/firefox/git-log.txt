    JIT: prefer edge counts; keep class profiles even if tossing counts (#85406)
    
    If there are both edge and block counts for a method, prefer to use the
    edge counts (block counts are no longer the default, so are more likely
    to be stale).
    
    Sometimes we decide not to use count data because of correlation or
    solver issues. When this happens, keep the class profile data viable
    and let the code that deals with class profiles handle the possibility
    of stale or mismatched data.
    
    Addresses some aspects of #84446, though it's still not clear why we see
    static profiles with both block and edge counts.
