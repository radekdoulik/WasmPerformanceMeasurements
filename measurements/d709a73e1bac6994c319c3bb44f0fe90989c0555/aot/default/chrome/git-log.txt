    JIT: Always intersect exception sets of defs (#116007)
    
    The existing logic would only intersect the exception sets of subsequent
    defs if it had also seen a use. That meant for a list [DEF, DEF, USE] of
    CSE candidates we would only validate that the first def's exception
    sets were sufficient for the use.
