    [wasm] Implement the ENDFINALLY opcode in the jiterpreter (#84273)
    
    * Mark the opcode following CALL_HANDLER interpreter opcodes as a back branch target
    * In the jiterpreter, record each CALL_HANDLER location when compiling them
    * Then when compiling an ENDFINALLY opcode check to see whether the branch target is one we recognize and if so do a branch, otherwise bail out
    * Tweak CFG to filter out branch targets that are never used
    * Add browser-bench measurement for try-finally
