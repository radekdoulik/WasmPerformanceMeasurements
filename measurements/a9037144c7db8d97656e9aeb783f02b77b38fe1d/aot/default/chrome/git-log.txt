    Fix building ILC in Visual Studio (#99799)
    
    ILC stopped building in VS recently. There's a disagreement between where build.cmd places the ILLink Roslyn analyzer and where the VS build expects to find the analyzer DLL. (The disagreement is about whether `$(Platform)` is part of the path.)
    
    I couldn't quickly find out why, so just do what every sln file under libraries does - include the analyzer in the solution...
