    Enable `UseSizeOptimizedLinq` by default on native AOT (#113214)
    
    The motivation is:
    
    * This has been enabled by default on mobile platforms for several releases and it wasn't a source of issues
    * It is easy to opt out of it. (That cannot be said about mobile platforms in the past that hardcoded it at repo build).
    * Doesn't have measurable throughput impact on any ASP.NET scenarios we measure perf of.
    * It is a meaningful size saving (seen 5+%).
