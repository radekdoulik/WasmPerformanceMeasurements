    Add support for the ISOSDacInterface14 api (#100364)
    
    * Add support for the ISOSDacInterface14 api
    - This is a split out of the diagnostics changes associated with PR #99183
    - This will allow the removal of the useability of the DomainLocalModule apis from ISOSDacInterface without changing the functionality of the interface by allowing consumers to move to the new apis - NOTE, the SOS_BREAKING_CHANGE number is expected to move from 4 to 5 at that point, so users of ISOSDacInterface which understand ISOSDacInterface14 should indicate that they understand version 5.
