    JIT: Remove BBJ_NONE (#94239)
    
    Next step for #93020, per conversation on #93772. Replacing BBJ_NONE with BBJ_ALWAYS to the next block helps limit our use of implicit fall-through (though we still expect BBJ_COND to fall through when its false branch is taken; #93772 should eventually address this).
    
    I've added a small peephole optimization to skip emitting unconditional branches to the next block during codegen.
