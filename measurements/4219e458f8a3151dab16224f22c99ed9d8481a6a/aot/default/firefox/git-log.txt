    [wasm] Optimize mmap and lock-free allocator
    
    * Use 64kb pages instead of 16kb pages in the lock-free allocator if custom mmap is active to reduce wasted memory
    * Request non-zeroed pages from custom mmap in lock free allocator, since all of its callers memset their allocations anyway
