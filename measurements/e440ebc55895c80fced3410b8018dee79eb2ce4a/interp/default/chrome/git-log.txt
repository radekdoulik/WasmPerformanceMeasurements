    Fix printing Helix workitems count for Android (#95061)
    
    I noticed that we printed "Done building Helix work items. Work item count: 0" in the Send to Helix step for Android jobs. This is because we only looked at Apple-specific XHarnessAppBundleToTest items in sendtohelix-mobile.proj.
    
    Simplified this logic a bit so we can print in sendtohelixhelp.proj instead together with the non-mobile message.
