    Add basic support for `TYP_MASK` constants (#99743)
    
    This is to support fixing JitOptRepeat (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/94250).
    I was seeing failures in a Tensor test where `TYP_MASK`
    generating instructions were getting CSE'd. When OptRepeat kicks in
    and runs VN over the new IR, it wants to create a "zero" value
    for the new CSE locals.
    
    This change creates a `TYP_MASK` constant type, `simdmask_t`, like the
    pre-existing `simd64_t`, `simd32_t`, etc. `simdmask_t` is basically a
    `simd8_t` type, but with its own type. I expanded basically every place
    that generally handles `simd64_t` with `simdmask_t` support. This might be
    more than we currently need, but it seems to be a reasonable step towards
    making `TYP_MASK` more first-class. However, I didn't go so far as to
    support load/store of these constants, for example.
