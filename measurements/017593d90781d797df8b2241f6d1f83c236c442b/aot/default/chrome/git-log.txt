    JIT: Avoid relying on bbNum to find lexical loop boundaries (#101714)
    
    Switch `FlowGraphNaturalLoop::GetLexicallyTopMostBlock` and
    `FlowGraphNaturalLoop::GetLexicallyBottomMostBlock` to more robust
    implementations that scan the basic block list forwards (and backwards)
    to find the boundary blocks.
    
    Fix #101695
