    JIT: Invalidate old loop table immediately (#96613)
    
    Invalidate the old loop table immediately after old loop finding. Remove
    `m_oldToNewLoop` and `m_newToOldLoop`. Move `BBF_OLD_LOOP_HEADER_QUIRK` to be
    set directly by old loop finding, and remove the flag manually in loop
    cloning/unrolling, since it is being set when we clone the blocks.
