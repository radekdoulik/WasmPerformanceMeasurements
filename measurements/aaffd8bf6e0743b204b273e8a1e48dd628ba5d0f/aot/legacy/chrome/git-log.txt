    Generate debug info even if managed debug info not present (#87251)
    
    The names/types of parameters are available even without a PDB in .NET - surface them to the native debugger.
    
    We could also surface fake information about locals because the type information is there (just no names/compiler generated bit), but it's unclear if that would be an improvement.
