    [mono] Fix output directory for cross compilers if OutputRID is overridden (#109932)
    
    This happens e.g. in the VMR where OutputRID is set globally. We assumed in monoaotcross.proj that the inner mono cross compiler runtime build would put files into a path that matches the target RID but we were using OutputRID in the inner build.
    
    Instead use the preexisting MonoAotCrossDir property.
    
    Also fix marking DotNetBuildMonoCrossAOT=true as a ShortStack build.
