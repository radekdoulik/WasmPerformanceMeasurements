    Propagate RuntimeConfiguration for cross-subset builds (#107049)
    
    This addresses issues building cross-subset with clr (or mono) with mixed configurations.
    
    For example, `singlefilehost` is built as part of the `clr` subset, but the `host` subset copies it, embeds the DAC (when necessary) and packages it. When the clr and host configuration didn't match, this resulted in the host build looking for `singlefilehost` in the wrong location.
