    JIT: Add missing `lvTracked` check in `optLocalHasNonLoopUses` (#109505)
    
    `optLocalHasNonLoopUses` checks if a local might be used after a loop by
    making use of its liveness information, but it does not check
    `lvTracked` before doing so. This is generally not a problem as there
    are other checks that the local is in SSA, and normally SSA implies
    lvTracked, but that's not the case for locals put into SSA by CSE.
    
    Since it is possible to have CSE defs in a loop with uses outside the
    loop, this check is necessary for correctness. It is expected to regress
    a bunch of IV opts cases, but in the future we can get those back by
    computing the necessary liveness when we insert into SSA.
