    JIT: Fix exponential blowup of memory dependency arrays in VNForMapSelectWork (#93344)
    
    Switch to sets when accumulating the memory dependencies found in
    VNForMapSelectWork. Otherwise we might duplicate each memory dependency
    for every path back to the store that induced it, and there can be an
    exponential number of those.
    
    Fix #93342
