    Add ILLink/ILCompiler support for feature checks (#99267)
    
    This will substitute static boolean properties with `false` when
    decorated with `[FeatureGuard(typeof(SomeFeature))]`, where
    `SomeFeature` is known to be disabled.
    
    The "feature" of unreferenced code, represented by
    `RequiresUnreferencedCodeAttribute`, is always considered
    disabled. For ILC, `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` and
    `RequiresAssemblyFilesAttribute` are also disabled. ILLink also
    respects the feature switch for `IsDynamicCodeSupported` to
    disable the `RequiresDynamicCodeAttribute` feature.
    
    We don't want this kicking in when trimming in library mode, so
    this adds an ILLink option to disable the optimization.
    
    Additionally, a property is substituted if it has
    `[FeatureSwitchDefinition("SomeFeatureName")]` and
    `"SomeFeatureName"` is set in the command-line arguments.
    
    XML substitutions take precedence over this behavior.
    
    Includes a few tweaks and cleanup to the analyzer logic.
