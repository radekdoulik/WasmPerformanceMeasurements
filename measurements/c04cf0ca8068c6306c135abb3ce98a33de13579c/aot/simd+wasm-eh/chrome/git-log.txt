    Split and simplify `fgMorphOneAsgBlockOp` (#76793)
    
    * Delete gtNewCpObjNode
    
    * Import INITOBJ of primitives as STIND
    
    No point in creating block nodes for simple types.
    
    * Retype local FP stores too
    
    Avoids a couple regressions.
    
    * Handle a bit of what OneAsg morphing does in block morphing
    
    * Slim down fgMorphOneAsgBlockOp
    
    A zero-diff checkpoint.
    
    * Slim down fgMorphOneAsgBlockOp, part 2
    
    A zero-diff checkpoint.
    
    * Slim down fgMorphOneAsgBlockOp, final part
    
    3 small regressions across all of SPMI due to less aggressive
    CSEing ("LCL_FLD" is costed cheaper than "IND(ADDR(LCL_VAR))").
    
    * Don't call OneAsg for init blocks
    
    * Delete assertion killing dead code
    
    PrepareDst will have killed assertions already.
    
    * Don't call gtSetObjGcInfo
