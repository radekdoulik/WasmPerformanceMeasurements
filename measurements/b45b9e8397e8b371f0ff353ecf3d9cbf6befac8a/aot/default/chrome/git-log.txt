    Use type-level annotations for trimming/AOT analysis (#109571)
    
    Gets rid of a few warning suppressions on instance members where we
    annotated constructors, by moving the constructor annotations to the
    type level. In a few cases this required moving some static methods to
    a separate class so that they don't produce warnings when called.
