    Remove helper method frame from Profiler hooks (#107152)
    
    Remove helper method frame and update the CONTRACTs to suit the new behavior. This WILL change the profiler behavior in that a set of apis in the Profiler api surface will not fail immediately on any attempt to use them. However, the set of apis which change are I believe not safe to call within a ProfilerEnter/Leave hook as an actual triggered GC will cause potential memory corruption if the arguments/return value of the function have any GC pointers.
