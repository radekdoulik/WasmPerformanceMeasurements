    Use FeatureSwitchDefinition in a few places (#106564)
    
    This replaces much of our ILLink.Substitutions.xml with nearly
    equivalent FeatureSwitchDefinitionAttribute. The minor difference is
    that both true and false are substituted (when the feature switch is
    set accordingly), whereas some of our substitution xmls only defined a
    substitution for the false case.
