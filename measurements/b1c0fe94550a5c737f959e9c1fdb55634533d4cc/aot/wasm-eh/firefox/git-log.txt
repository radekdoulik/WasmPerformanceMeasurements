    [wasm] Wasm.Build.Tests improvements (#76381)
    
    * InstallWorkloadFromArtifacts: Remove hack because we have an updated sdk now
    
    * [wasm] WBT: Make project names unique
    
    * [wasm] WBT: Use a clean NUGET_PACKAGES dir separate from the project directory
    
    * [wasm] WBT: Fixes to work with latest sdk
    
    - Use only one source of which tfm to use
    - Allow a different tfm for blazor
    - Add `dotnet8` nuget feed for tests
    - Support more than one choice for nuget.config, like for net7, or net8
    
    * WBT: Revert to test projects created in bindir, instead of a temp one
    
    This was necessary because on windows the tmp path is very long, causing
    the test project paths to become too long causing build failures.
    
    * [wasm] fix weird build failures
    
    `MSBuildSDKsPath` is set by runtime repo, and that interferes with the
    test projects. To avoid this the `MSBuildSDKsPath` was set to `""` in
    the test environment. But even that can negatively affect the build
    because msbuild treats environment variables as "global properties" that
    cannot be changed. This manifests when running:
    
    `$ dotnet run --no-build`
    
    .. it would fail with `/foo/bar.csproj is not a valid project file`.
    
    Instead, explicitly *remove* `MSBuildSDKsPath` from the environment when
    invoking the process.
    
    * WBT: PInvokeTableGenerator: Find path to WasmAppBuilder.dll at test time
    
    .. instead of depending on *one* runtime pack version. This is needed
    when we have more than one workload installed.
    
    * WBT: Don't use the nuget packages directory as fallback.
    
    .. because we explicitly set `NUGET_PACKAGES` envvar now.
    
    * [wasm] Use the latest sdk for Wasm.Build.Tests
    
    * WBT: Add missing nuget8.config
    
    * WBT: workaround for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/76201
    
    * WasmAppHost: add rollforward=latestMajor
