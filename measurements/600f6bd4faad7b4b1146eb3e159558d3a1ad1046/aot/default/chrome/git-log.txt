    Fix thread static cleanup paths (#107438)
    
    * Fix thread static cleanup paths
    - Do not destroy GC handles while holding the spin lock
    - Free the pLoaderHandle array when the thread is terminated
    
    * When using a ThreadStatics stress test on collectible assemblies, a few more issues were found
    - Fix issue where the LoaderAllocator's SegmentedHandleIndex wasn't being freed
    - Fix issue where the logic to re-use TLSIndex values wasn't working properly
