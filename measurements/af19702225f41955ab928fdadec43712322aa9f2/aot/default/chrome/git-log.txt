    Improve constant value analysis for method IL (#117084)
    
    Refactors `TryGetMethodConstantValue` to use a stack-based IL interpreter, enabling more robust constant folding and handling of more complex control flow and method calls. This addresses patterns that often show up around Metrics code (calling a helper that checks several diagnostic switches like `someLog.Log.IsSupported` and using it in an `if` check).
