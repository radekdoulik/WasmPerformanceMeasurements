    Update Enumerable.Min/Max for all IBinaryIntegers (#96605)
    
    The implementations are special-casing most of the built-in ones, in order to delegate to the IBinaryInteger-constrained helper, but it was missing Int128, UInt128, and char. ?hese won't be vectorized, but they'll at least use the more streamlined non-vectorized implementations.
