    Build the PGO build legs through the global build job template (#92296)
    
    * Build the PGO build legs through the global build job template.
    
    * Remove pgoType parameters and plumbing from all jobs and use the -pgoinstrument flag instead of setting the property manually.
    
    * Limit subsets to build to limit packages and don't build crossgen2 sfxproj for internal optimization pipelines (we don't use it).
    
    * Fix job dependencies now that the non-global jobs don't have PGO type in the name
    
    * Change back to the triple-underscore name
    
    * Fix Mono artifacts to not have an extra underscore for PGO scenarios.
    
    * There's an extra underscore for the CoreCLR artifacts because there's no runtime variant.
