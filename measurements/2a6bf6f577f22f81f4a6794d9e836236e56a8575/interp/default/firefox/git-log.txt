    Change Vector2/3/4, Quaternion, Plane, Vector<T>, and Vector64/128/256/512<T> to be implemented in managed where trivially possible (#102301)
    
    * Change Vector4 to be implemented entirely in managed
    
    * Change Plane to be implemented entirely in managed
    
    * Change Quaternion to be implemented entirely in managed
    
    * Avoid accidental recursion on Mono
    
    * Change Vector2/3, Vector<T>, and Vector64/128/256/512<T> to be implemented in managed where trivially possible
    
    * Don't regress the implementation of Dot
    
    * Fixing the handling of Vector512.CreateScalar
    
    * Continue tracking the System.Numerics and System.Runtime.Intrinsics APIs as intrinsic for the profitability boost
    
    * Don't use Unsafe.BitCast on Mono
