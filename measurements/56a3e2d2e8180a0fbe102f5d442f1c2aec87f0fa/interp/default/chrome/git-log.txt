    Simplify generic floating point->integer conversions (#116896)
    
    Floating point to integer conversions for 32-bit and 64-bit integers have predictable saturating behavior on all platforms now. The manual saturation should be unnecessary.
    
    Keep the existing behavior for Mono since Mono has not been fixed to have the predictable saturating behavior.
