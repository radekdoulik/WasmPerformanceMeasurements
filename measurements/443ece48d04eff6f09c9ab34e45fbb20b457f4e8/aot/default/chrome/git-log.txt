    * Remove references to project board automation
    
    * Update milestone conditions to be compatible with policy-service migration
    
    * Remove disabled automation
    
    * Remove 'maintain' permission check (behaves the same as 'write')
    
    * Use the isPr condition everywhere it was implied before
    
    * Use the isIssue condition everywhere it was implied before
