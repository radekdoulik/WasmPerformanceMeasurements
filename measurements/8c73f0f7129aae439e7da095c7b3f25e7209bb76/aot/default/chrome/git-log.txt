    Disable dump creation for ParallelCrashTester child (#97095)
    
    The child process is intentionally crashing, so creating a dump for it
    is a waste of time and disk space and it also seems to be causing random
    failures of the test in the CI.
    
    This change disables the dump creation for it.
