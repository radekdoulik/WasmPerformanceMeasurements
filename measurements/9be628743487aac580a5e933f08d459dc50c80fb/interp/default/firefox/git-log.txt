    [mono][gc] Remove reliance on regs/stack scanning in some cases (#101478)
    
    * [mono][sgen] Allocated gchandle for this object when invoking finalizers
    
    We were assuming the object is kept alive from the stack/regs, which is not reliable on wasm.
    
    * [mono][metadata] Allocate handle while operating with newly allocated RuntimeType
    
    * Enable test suite
