    Prevent tests from importing "normal" NuGet props/targets (#80573)
    
    We import them manually from a shared location.
    
    Usually this is not a problem because batch build (via the build script)
    does its own restore thing, but it is a problem in case the project is
    restored on its own, such as when it is built with "dotnet build".
