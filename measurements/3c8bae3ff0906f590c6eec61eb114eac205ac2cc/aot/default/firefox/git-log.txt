    JIT: also run local assertion prop in postorder during morph (#115626)
    
    Morph currently applies assertions in preorder, so updates made by morph or by local assertion prop to child trees cannot be leveraged when considering parents.
    
    For instance if we had
    ```
    V01 = newarr
    V05 = V01
    if (V05 == null)
    ```
    morph was unable to resolve the branch, despite generating both `V01 != null` and `V05 == V01`.
    
    To address this, keep track of the assertions valid at the end of each statement (via `apLocalPostorder`), and use those assertions during morph postorder to try and optimize further. This assertion set is kept up to date with any subsequent kills, and (for simplicity) cleared out if there is a qmark.
    
    Note morph can't use the current (`apLocal`) assertion set in postorder because morph may also reorder subtrees, so in postorder might end up using assertions generated by (formerly) later-executing subtrees to optimize now earlier-executing subtrees.
