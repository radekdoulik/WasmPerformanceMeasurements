    Remove JitGenericHandleCache (#106843)
    
    - It was only used for overflow scenarios from the generic dictionary (which don't happen), virtual resolution scenarios for creating delegates, and a few other rare R2R scenarios
    - Replace the virtual resolution scenarios with a cache of the affected data in managed code, and move the helpers to managed
      - Use the GenericCache type which was previously only used on NativeAOT for Generic Virtual method resolution paths.
    - Just remove the pointless checks from within the various normal generic lookup paths, and since they no longer do anything interesting in their hot paths except erect a helper method frame and call a worker routine, move those jit helpers to managed as well.
