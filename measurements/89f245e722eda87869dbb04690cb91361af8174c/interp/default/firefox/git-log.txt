    [NRBF] Remove array allocation when decoding `decimal`s. (#107797)
    
    By directly passing a collection expression to `decimal`'s constructor, we avoid allocating an array on frameworks that have an overload that accepts a `ReadOnlySpan<int>`, in which case the span's memory is allocated on the stack.
