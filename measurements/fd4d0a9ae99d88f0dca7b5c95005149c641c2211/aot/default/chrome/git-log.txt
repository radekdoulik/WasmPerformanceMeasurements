    [cdac] Tighten cdac_data friend declarations (#108525)
    
    tighten cdac_data friend declarations
    
    Previously classes exposed internals to all cdac_data specializations. By changing the
    friend declarations to the exact specialization which needs will access the internals,
    we can better verify where the internals are accessed and ensure cdac_data<T> accesses
    the correct class.
