    [mono] Fix condition for disabling extra checks in verify_class_overrides (#101445)
    
    `ENABLE_CHECKED_BUILD` is defined to mean "Enable additional checks" and is enabled in checked and debug builds. Therefore this performance optimization should be enabled when `ENABLE_CHECKED_BUILD` is *not* defined. Ref: #101312
