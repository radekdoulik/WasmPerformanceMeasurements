    Preserve static type info for return value of ctor (#101212)
    
    Instead of tracking the return value as "TopValue" or "unknown",
    this models the constructor as returning a value with a static
    type when called with newobj, letting us undo the workaround from
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/101031.
