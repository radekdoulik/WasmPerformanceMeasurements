    Don't allow preinitialization to skip dataflow (#98318)
    
    Fixes #97286.
    
    This just aborts preinitialization if we see dataflow might be involved. It's a conservative fix. We don't have a good spot to communicate dataflow need (e.g. _everything_ from the cctor could potentially be optimized away if the codegen inlines that knowledge).
