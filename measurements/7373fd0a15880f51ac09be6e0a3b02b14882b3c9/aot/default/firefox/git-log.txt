    JIT: capture all write barrier helper addresses for SPMI (#97535)
    
    When varying CSEs we can sometimes alter the write barrier that is
    needed. In particular if we CSE a heap address computation we may
    lose track of the fact that an indir is writing to the heap, and so
    change which write barrier needs to be used.
    
    See #97534.
    
    Even if that's fixed it seems like we still might change our minds
    for various reasons, so when running under SPMI, just collect all
    the possible write barrier helper addresses.
