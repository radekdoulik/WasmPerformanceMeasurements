    Fix dataflow analysis for GetNestedType (#109814)
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/linker/pull/2133 adjusted rooting logic to keep `.All` on all nested types preserved with PublicNestedTypes/NonPublicNestedTypes. The PR resolved the bug and the analysis work that was identified in the review as necessary never happened. So we just uselessly preserve members.
    
    This adds dataflow analysis to propagate this. Since we never had the dataflow analysis, I'm exposing this not as .All, but a subset of .All that doesn't do the worst part - doesn't require reflectability of interface methods.
