    Simplify jitconfigvalues.h (#100704)
    
    * Simplify jitconfigvalues.h
    
    It's been confusing to know if a configuration switch is available
    in DEBUG or non-DEBUG (Release) builds because you need to figure
    out which `ifdef` section it is defined in.
    
    This simplifies it by eliminating `#ifdef DEBUG` in jitconfigvalues.h.
    Each config variable is explicitly using `CONFIG_...` for DEBUG or
    `RELEASE_CONFIG_...` for non-DEBUG builds.
    
    I reformatted some of the CONFIG definitions to put the comments before
    the CONFIG definition instead of on the same line, so they read better
    after jit-format processes them.
    
    * Fix OPT_CONFIG defines
