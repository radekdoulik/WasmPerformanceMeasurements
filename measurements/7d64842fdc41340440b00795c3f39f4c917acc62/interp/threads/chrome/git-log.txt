    [RISC-V][LoongArch64] New passing info for floating-point structs (#103945)
    
    * Replace StructFloatFieldInfoFlags with FpStructInRegistersInfo which carries also exact field sizes and offsets
    
    * Replace StructFloatFieldInfoFlags with FpStruct::Flags in profiler
    
    * Remove FpStructInRegistersInfo::FromOldFlags()
    
    * Fix duplicating types in HandleInlineArray
    
    * Remove signedness from FpStruct::IntKind because most probably we won't need it
    
    * Remove old StructFloatFieldInfoFlags calculating routine
    
    * Typo in TARGET_LOONGARCH64
    
    * Remove m_returnedFpFieldOffsets from ArgIterator
    
    * Add missing ENREGISTERED_PARAMTYPE_MAXSIZE condition to C# version of FpStruct info calculation
    
    * Rename RISCV64PassStructInRegister to match settled casing for RiscV in class names
    
    * Update hardcoded flags for float and double in ArgIteratorTemplate::ComputeReturnFlags()
    
    This fixes JIT/HardwareIntrinsics/General/Vector* tests.
    
    * Fix build on other platforms
    
    * Update LoongArch to use FpStructInRegistersInfo
    
    * Remove unused old flag masks
    
    * LoongArch64 typo

    * Use FpStruct namespace everywhere in JIT
    
    * JIT review
    
    * Update StructFloatFieldInfoFlags description
    
    * Revert to hitherto instruction set order as it's not the point of this PR
    
    * Unify get{LoongArch,RiscV}64PassFpStructInRegistersInfo JIT interfaces
    
    * Use JIT_TO_EE_TRANSITION instead of _LEAF because MethodTable::GetFpStructInRegistersInfo may throw
    
    * Remove FpStruct::IntKind, we should have similar info in ClassLayout in JIT
    
    * Change JIT interface to return a struct similar to CORINFO_SWIFT_LOWERING to facilitate code unification in the future
    
    * Change JIT to use new Swift-like getFpStructLowering
    
    * Cache CORINFO_FPSTRUCT_LOWERING
    
    * Update LoongArch classifier to use CORINFO_FPSTRUCT_LOWERING
    
    * Update StructFloatInfoFlags doc comment on C#
    
    * Move StructFloatFieldInfoFlags and FpStructInRegistersInfo out of the JIT interface
    
    * Merge LoongArch and RISC-V AOT calculation of FpStructInRegistersInfo because they were identical. Move it to Common\Internal/Runtime because it's no longer exposed in JIT interface.
    
    * Don't zero-initialize CORINFO_FPSTRUCT_LOWERING
    
    * Add note for CORINFO_FPSTRUCT_LOWERING::loweredElements type
