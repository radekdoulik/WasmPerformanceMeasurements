    Fix detection of lambda and local function generated names (#103916)
    
    And share code between ILLink and Native AOT.
    
    Lambdas and local functions inside explicitly-implemented interface
    methods include the interface type in the generated name. When the
    interface type is generic, this breaks our heuristics (which were
    looking for the first `>` to indicate the end of the user method name
    in the generated method). This updates the heuristic to look for the
    last `>` instead.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98368
