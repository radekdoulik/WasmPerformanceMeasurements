    Delete `GT_OBJ` (#84221)
    
    * Delete dependencies on the handle from OBJ
    
    * Delete GT_OBJ
    
    GT_OBJ and GT_OBJ both represent struct loads. There is no need to have two.
    
    Delete GT_OBJ as the more derived one.
    
    * gtNewObjNode -> gtNewBlkIndir
    
    * Fix up RISC-V
