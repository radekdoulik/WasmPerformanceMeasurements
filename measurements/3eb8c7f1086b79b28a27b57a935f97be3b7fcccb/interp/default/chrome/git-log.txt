    JIT: Add pred block iterator that tolerates pred list modifications (#99466)
    
    Follow-up to #99362. fgRedirectTargetEdge modifies the predecessor lists of the old and new successor blocks, so if we want to be able to use it in fgReplaceJumpTarget, we need a pred block iterator that is resilient to these changes, as we frequently call the latter method while iterating predecessors.
