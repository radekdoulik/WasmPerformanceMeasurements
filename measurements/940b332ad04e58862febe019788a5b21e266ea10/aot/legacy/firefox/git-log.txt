    [mini] Fix typo in mono_decompose_vtype_opts (#90825)
    
    * Fix typo in mono_decompose_vtype_opts
    
    Without this, if some previous instruction already created a vreg for
    ins->dest (for example if we are doing multiple passes over the basic
    block because `restart == TRUE`) we will use an incorrect vreg when
    decomposing the current VMOVE
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90800
    
    * Only emit an OP_LDTOKEN_FIELD if we loaded a field token
    
    This is used by a CreateSpan optimization that needs access to the
    MonoClassField*
    
    For other cases of a bare LDTOKEN (such as hand-written IL that calls
    LDTOKEN on a type but doesn't follow it up with a call to
    `GetTypeFromHandle` leave the opcode as a VMOVE (from the
    `EMIT_NEW_TEMPLOAD` above))
