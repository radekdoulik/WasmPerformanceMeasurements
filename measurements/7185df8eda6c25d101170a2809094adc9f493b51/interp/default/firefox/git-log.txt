    Add some eventlog APIs to WindowsAPIs.txt (#98545)
    
    Hello world size regressed by 50 kB because we now need the lazy p/invoke code paths. This API is present in OneCore.lib and has existed since at least Windows 2000. It's missing in mincore.lib, but AFAIK mincore is pretty much deprecated.
