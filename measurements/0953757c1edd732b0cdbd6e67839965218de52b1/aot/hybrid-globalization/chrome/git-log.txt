    Cache the path on `Module` for easier diagnostics (#106103)
    
    - Make `PEImage` take a path in its constructor and make its member const
    - Store the path when initializing `Module`
    
    This will let us avoid having to expose PEAssembly/PEImage in data descriptors to the cDAC just to get the module path.
