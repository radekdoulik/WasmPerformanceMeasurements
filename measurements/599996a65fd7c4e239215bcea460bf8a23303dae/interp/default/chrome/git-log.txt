    Fix GetInterfaceMap with respect to generics (#113611)
    
    This API is still generally broken because the partial implementation from https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8144 is still only partial, but this should either return correct result or throw. Here we can compute the correct result. Full fix still tracked at #89157.
