    ILLink: fix TypeProxy implementation of equality (#106990)
    
    The equality check needs to determine whether two TypeProxy instances
    represent the same type. The check was incorrect when two different
    object instances were allocated to represent the same generic
    instantiated type.
    
    ILCompiler doesn't have this problem because it uses a cache to ensure
    that the same object instance represents a given instantiated generic
    type.
    
    Discovered while investigating
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/106215, see more context at
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/106215#discussion_r1725737204.
    
    The new testcase also uncovered an issue in the analyzer that was
    fixed in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/106909.
