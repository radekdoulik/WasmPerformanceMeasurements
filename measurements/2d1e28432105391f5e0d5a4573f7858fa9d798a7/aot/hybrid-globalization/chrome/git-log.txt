    Fix exe size for Mach-O files (#89325)
    
    The extra size appears to be the export list, which is zeroed
    but not removed when the file is stripped. Exes shouldn't have
    any exported symbols by default, but ld will include everything
    by default. We'll fix it up using an ld flag.
    
    Fixes #86707
