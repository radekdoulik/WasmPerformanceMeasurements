    Add build option to build Mac .dSYM debug symbol bundles (#100617)
    
    This is a small workaround to allow developers working on Mac the
    ability to generate .dSYM bundles as part of inner-loop development,
    instead of the unsupported .dwarf files that are generated by default.
    
    A full solution to use .dSYM bundles everywhere on Mac, including
    packaging and symbol indexing, is tracked by
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/92911.
    
    To build .dSYM bundles instead of .dwarf files, invoke build.sh as
    follows:
    
    ```bash
    ./build.sh --subset clr --cmakeargs "-DCLR_CMAKE_APPLE_DSYM=TRUE"
    ```
