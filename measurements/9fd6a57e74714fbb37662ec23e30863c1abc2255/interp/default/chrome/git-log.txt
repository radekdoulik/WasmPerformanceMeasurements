    Add an IsFuncletCache to the EECodeInfo (#114580)
    
    * Add an IsFuncletCache to the EECodeInfo, and do a cheap computation at EECodeInfo::Init time to fill it in if there aren't any funclets in the method
    - This avoids the fairly complex IsFunclet logic on the JitManager, as well as the virtual call to get there in some cases.
    
    * Code review feedback to make this a bit more like the other optimized cases in EECodeInfo
