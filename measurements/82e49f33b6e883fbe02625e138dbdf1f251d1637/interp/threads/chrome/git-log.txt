    Fix getting instantiation type handles for generic subclasses (#107014)
    
    We were always using the first instantiation dictionary when getting the type handles for the instantiation of a type. For types with inherited ones, we'd end up with the base class dictionary instead of the specific type.
    
    - Add GenericsDictInfo::NumDicts to the data descriptor
    - Update the `RuntimeTypeSystem` contract implementation to use the last dictionary (the one for the specific type)
