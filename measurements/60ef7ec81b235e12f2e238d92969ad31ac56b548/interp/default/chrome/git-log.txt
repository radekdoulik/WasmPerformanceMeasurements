    JIT: revise how synthesis treats handler regions (#100899)
    
    Instead of giving hander regions a fraction of the entry weight, give them a small
    fixed weight. This is intended to combat the lack of profile propagation out of
    handler regions, where there are currently sometimes weight discontinuities large
    enough to cause profile check asserts.
    
    Contributes to #93020.
