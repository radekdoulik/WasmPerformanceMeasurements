    JIT: Reuse LSRA's block sequence for initial layout during block reordering (#110921)
    
    Follow-up to #108903. If LSRA did not introduce new basic blocks, we can reuse its block sequence as the initial layout during block reordering, avoiding the overhead of recomputing a loop-aware RPO. Also, delete some unused flowgraph-related `Compiler` members.
