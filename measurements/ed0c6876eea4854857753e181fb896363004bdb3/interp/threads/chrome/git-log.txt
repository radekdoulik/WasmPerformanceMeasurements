    JIT ARM64-SVE: Move SVE helpers to emitarm64sve.cpp (#100034)
    
    This change moves most (all?) SVE-specific helper methods and data structures from emitarm64.cpp to emitarm64sve.cpp, and renames a few of these helpers to make it clear they are specific to SVE/SVE2. Also, I opportunistically deleted some unused methods. The hex output of the SVE unit tests is unchanged.
