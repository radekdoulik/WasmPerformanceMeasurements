    JIT: extend copy prop to local fields (#74384)
    
    Allow copy prop to update GT_LCL_FLD nodes.
    
    Update local assertion gen for block opts to use a mid-morph (after child nodes
    are morphed) tree to generate copy or zero assertions, since the semantics of the
    post-morph tree are often obscured by the copy/zero expansions.
