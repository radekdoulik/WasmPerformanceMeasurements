    Fix handling of case-sensitive set loops in RegexPrefixAnalyzer.FindPrefixes (#101608)
    
    * Fix handling of case-sensitive set loops in RegexPrefixAnalyzer.FindPrefixes
    
    For an expression like `[Aa]{2}`, we were generating the strings "AA" and "aa" but not "Aa" or "aA".
    
    This code isn't exercised yet, as we're currently only using FindPrefixes for case-insensitive, but I'm trying to enable it for case-sensitive as well, and hit this. I'm not adding new tests here as plenty of existing tests catch it once it's enabled.
    
    * Also exit early as soon as we can detect too many possible prefixes
