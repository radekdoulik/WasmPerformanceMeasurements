    Fix stack walking for new EH (#99624)
    
    * Testing only - enable the new EH for excercising it
    
    * Fix stack walking for new EH
    
    There is an edge case when the StackFrameIterator was incorrectly
    setting the fShouldParentFrameUseUnwindTargetPCforGCReporting, which
    resulted in a 100% reproducible GC hole in the
    baseservices\exceptions\unittests\ThrowInFinallyNestedInTry with GC
    stress C and tiered compilation off.
    The fix is to delete code that is already present in an "if" branch
    above the change and that should really be executed only when the
    funclet parent is the caller of the actual handler frame.
    
    * Cleanup, reflecting feedback and fixing one last issue
    
    * Reflect PR feedback and fix asserts
    
    * Filter out InlinedCallFrame from updating the pointers
    
    InlinedCallFrame needs to be excluded from updating the context
    pointers, as it restores PC / SP to a different location than the
    callsite of the pinvoke and it doesn't update the context pointers
    anyways.
