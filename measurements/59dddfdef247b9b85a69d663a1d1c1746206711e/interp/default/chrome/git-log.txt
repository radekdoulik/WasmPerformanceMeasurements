    [Jiterpreter] Add support for TryGetHashCode intrinsic (#81644)
    
    #80520 added support in the Jiterpreter for the intrinsic that underlies RuntimeHelpers.GetHashCode. This PR adds similar support for the intrinsic that underlies RuntimeHelpers.TryGetHashCode.
    
    For reference RuntimeHelpers.TryGetHashCode was added in #80059. It is currently only used in ConditionalWeakTable.TryGetValue.
