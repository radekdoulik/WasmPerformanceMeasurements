    Make constructors private for parts of the ComInterfaceGenerator that should only be created from their static methods (#101740)
    
    Moves ComClassInfo to its own file and moves the Func that produces them in the ComClassGenerator pipeline to a static method on ComClassInfo.
    
    Makes the constructors for ComClassInfo, ComInterfaceContext, ComInterfaceInfo, and `ComMethoInfo private to enforce that they are only created from the static creation methods.
    
    Creates more static SpecialTypeInfo types for sbyte, uint, short, and ushort.
    
    Changes pattern matching on records to use property pattern matching rather than the deconstruction notation for records. Since the constructors are not accessible, neither are the deconstruct methods.
