    Enable NativeAOT runtime tests on MacCatalyst (#102882)
    
    This PR updates the CLRTest.Execute.Bash.targets file to set the apple run command for MacCatalyst. The command apple just-run used on Apple mobile is not permitted, and apple test requires the a test runner. Additionally, it is necessary to locate Info.plist in the Contents/ directory and the binary in Contents/MacOS/ within the bundle.
