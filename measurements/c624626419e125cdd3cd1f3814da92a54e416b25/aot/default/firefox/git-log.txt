    Consolidate importer spilling code (#72291)
    
    * Add tests
    
    * Fix losing GLOB_REF on the LHS
    
    The comment states we don't need it, which is incorrect.
    
    Diffs are improvements because we block forward substitution of
    calls into "ASG(BLK(ADDR(LCL_VAR<field>, ...)))", which allows
    morph to leave the "can be replaced with its field" local alone.
    
    * Prospective fix
    
    Spill "glob refs" on stores to "aliased" locals.
    
    * Delete now-not-necessary code
    
    * Fix up asserts
    
    * Clean out '(unsigned)CHECK_SPILL_ALL/NONE' casts
    
    * Don't manually spill for 'st[s]fld'
    
    * Revert 'Clean out '(unsigned)CHECK_SPILL_ALL/NONE' casts'
