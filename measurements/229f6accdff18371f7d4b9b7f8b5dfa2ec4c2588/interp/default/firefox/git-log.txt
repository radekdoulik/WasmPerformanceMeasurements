    JIT: introduce durable EH region ID (#113497)
    
    Give each EH clause a permanent ID unique to that clause. Use this
    to revise how we model GT_END_LFIN's nesting depth -- the node now
    refers to a region ID, and we use that plus a lookup table built
    during `FinalizeEH` to figure out the nesting depth.
    
    Contributes to #108900.
