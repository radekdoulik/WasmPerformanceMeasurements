    Fix negative lookaround stack handling (#99424)
    
    * Fix negative lookaround stack handling
    
    If the body of negative lookaround inside of a loop and containing a capture ends up successfully matching (which means the negative lookaround fails to match), it ends up erroneously leaving a position on the backtracking stack. This fix ensures that state is popped.
    
    * Add innerloop test
