    JIT: Use new ABI representation for x86 varargs handling (#100746)
    
    One difference is that the old representation counts register arguments
    when assigning stack offsets, so it has to subtract that amount off. The
    new representation does not need to do this as stack offsets only
    account for stack arguments.
    
    x86 is also different in that the managed calling convention pushes
    arguments in order and thus the parameters come in reverse order in the
    callee. That is, the first parameter is at the top of the stack
    arguments. The ABI representation therefore represents the stack offsets
    relative to the top of stack arguments instead of from the bottom on
    x86.
    
    Also introduce `Compiler::lvaGetParameterABIInfo` and switch all uses to
    use it instead of directly accessing the array.
