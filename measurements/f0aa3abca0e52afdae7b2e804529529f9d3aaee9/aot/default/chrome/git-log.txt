    Use invariant culture when formatting transfer capture in regex source generator (#113081)
    
    A balancing group can result in TransferCapture being emitted with a negative "capnum". If the compiler is running under a culture that uses something other than '-' as the negative sign, the resulting generated code will fail to compile.
