    [interp] Forcibly enable intrinsics when we encounter a must-expand call (#117727)
    
    * When encountering a must expand intrinsic self-call in an interpreted method, always expand it even if intrinsics are turned off.
    * Clean up a minor edge case in the 'is reference or contains references' intrinsic
    * Remove an alignment assert that is causing failures in the startup path
