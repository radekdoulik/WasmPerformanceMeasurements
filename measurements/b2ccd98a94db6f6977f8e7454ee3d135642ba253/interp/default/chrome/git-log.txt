    JIT: Produce special cased IR for boolean `isinst` checks (#103391)
    
    Currently the IR for boolean `isinst` checks ends up being something like `(x !=
    null ? x.mt == expectedMT ? x : null : null) != null`, which the JIT ends up
    having a hard time clean up early. With object stack allocation this pattern
    usually leads to unnecessary address exposure.
    
    This adds a simple pattern match during import to produce different IR in the
    common cases where the `isinst` is just used as a boolean check. We instead
    produce IR like `(x != null ? x.mt == expectedMT ? 1 : 0 : 0) != 0`, which the
    JIT has an easier time with.
