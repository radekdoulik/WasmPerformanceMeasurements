    JIT: Fix `resolveConflictingDefAndUse` to take kills into account (#103562)
    
    This function should have been updated as part of f95a76b to take into
    account that kills are no longer present in the RefPosition list for
    `RegRecord`s. We apparently did not see any issues as a result, but this
    PR fixes it to account for that.
