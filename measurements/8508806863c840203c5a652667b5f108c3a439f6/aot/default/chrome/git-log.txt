    Fix bug in virtual annotation logic for RequiresUnreferencedCode (#100707)
    
    The following virtual methods are correctly annotated and do not warn:
    
    ```csharp
    class Base {
      virtual void M() {}
    }
    
    [RequiresUnreferencedCode("Derived")]
    class Derived : Base {
      override void M() {}
    }
    ```
    
    However, if the method also happens to have DynamicallyAccessedMembers
    annotations, there's a bug in the logic that causes this to produce
    warnings in illink. This change fixes the bug.
    
    Hit this while experimenting with ComponentModel annotations.
