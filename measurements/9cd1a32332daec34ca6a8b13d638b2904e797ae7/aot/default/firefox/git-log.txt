    Convert more jit phases to opt into common post phase checks (#74041)
    
    * Rework the post importation phase
    * Rework the morph init phase
    * Rework fgAddInternal
    * Rework flow graph update phases, compute preds, and update finally flags
    * Rework struct promotion phase
    * Rework local morph
    * Rework morph implicit byrefs
    * Rework GS cookie phase
    * Rework compute block and edge weights
    * Rework create funclets
    * no funclets on x86, so no phase
    * account for some jit stress changes
    * review feedback
