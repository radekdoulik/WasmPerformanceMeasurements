    Wasm jiterpreter cleanup and bug fixes pt. 4 (#79324)
    
    * Instead of jitting interp_entry wrappers for every entry point, record a hit count for each one and then queue it for JIT compilation once it's hit enough times
    * Add prefs controlling interp entry queue thresholds
    * Add support for using imported globals for pointer constants (to enable future threading/caching), off by default
    * Use base 36 for jiterpreter import names to save space
