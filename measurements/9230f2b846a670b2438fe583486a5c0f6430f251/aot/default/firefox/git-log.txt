    Fix stack overflow handling with SuperPMI (#106495)
    
    * Fix stack overflow handling with SuperPMI
    
    When SuperPMI shared library is loaded last, its SIGSEGV handler
    is the first one that's executed. But since there is no coreclr runtime handler
    installed for it, it returns from the SwitchStackAndExecuteHandler in case
    of SIGSEGV. The remaining code in the SIGSEGV handler was not expecting that and
    thought that there was no stack overflow and attempted to run the hardware exception
    handler on the original stack of the thread, which obviously crashed since the original
    stack overflowed.
    The fix is to make sure that we only call the previously registered signal handler in
    this case.
