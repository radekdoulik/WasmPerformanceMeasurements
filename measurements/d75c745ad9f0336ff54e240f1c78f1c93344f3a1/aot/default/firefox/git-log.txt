    Warn on message formatting failure instead of crash, and fix Native AOT MakeGenericType failure (#110330)
    
    ILC doesn't make sure that an instantiation from MakeGenericType/Method fulfills the constraints of the generic type/method, which can create to nonsense types that fail asserts in other places. The fix is to ensure that the constraints are valid before determining the dependencies of the instantiated generic.
