    Remove static monitor helper functions (#107667)
    
    - Replace them with using the normal monitor helpers
    - Change CORINFO_HELP_GETSYNCFROMCLASSHANDLE to return an `object` instead of the underlying lock object, implementation of the JIT helper can be shared with other `TypeHandle` to `RuntimeType` scenarios
    - This will likely improve the performance of synchronized methods, but that is beside the point, since this feature is so rarely used
