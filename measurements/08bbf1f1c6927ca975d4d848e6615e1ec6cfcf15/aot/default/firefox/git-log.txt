    Fix getting default install location for x64 when running x86 host on x64 Windows (#108538)
    
    - Handle x86 on x64 looking for x64 install so that it looks at `ProgramW6432` instead of `ProgramFiles`
    - Just check `ProgramFiles` for when determining location for current arch
      - We were unnecessarily checking `ProgramFiles(x86)` for x86 running in wow64
    
    Because this is looking at machine-wide locations, our tests don't actually go down this path (tests for default install location go through a test-only environment variable which bypasses the ProgramFiles environment variables lookup).
