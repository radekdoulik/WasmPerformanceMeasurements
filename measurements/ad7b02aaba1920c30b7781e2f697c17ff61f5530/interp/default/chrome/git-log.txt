    [NRBF] Comments and bug fixes from internal code review (#107735)
    
    * copy comments and asserts from Levis internal code review
    
    * apply Levis suggestion: don't store Array.MaxLength as a const, as it may change in the future
    
    * add missing and fix some of the existing comments
    
    * first bug fix: SerializationRecord.TypeNameMatches should throw ArgumentNullException for null Type argument
    
    * second bug fix: SerializationRecord.TypeNameMatches should know the difference between SZArray and single-dimension, non-zero offset arrays (example: int[] and int[*])
    
    * third bug fix: don't cast bytes to booleans
    
    * fourth bug fix: don't cast bytes to DateTimes
    
    * add one test case that I've forgot in previous PR
