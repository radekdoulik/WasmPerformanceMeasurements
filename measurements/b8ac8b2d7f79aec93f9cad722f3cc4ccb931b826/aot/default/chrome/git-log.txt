    JIT: Refine post-dominance check in strength reduction (#104687)
    
    When strength reduction has to find an insertion point for the new
    primary IV update it needs to find a block that post-dominates all the
    users of the IV. This was using `optReachable` before, but that is
    conservative since it finds paths that may exit the loop. This
    implements a more precise check.
