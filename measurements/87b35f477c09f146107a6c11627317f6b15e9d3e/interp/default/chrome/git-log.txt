    JIT: Avoid implicit byref retbufs in async calls (#115888)
    
    The check in the importer did not take into account that a `LCL_ADDR` of
    an implicit byref local will turn into `LCL_VAR` after morph. The async
    transformation requires the retbuf to be the address of a local, so
    enhance the check to take this into account.
    
    Also switch the `compIsAsync()` check to `call->IsAsync()`. Inside async
    functions it is ok for non-async calls to use the normal logic.
