    JIT: Remove "add copies" phase (#83310)
    
    This phase seems to try to do some ad-hoc live range splitting to improve things in assertion prop, but it almost barely kicks in.
    When it does kick in it seems to overall be a regression, both in ASM diffs and in TP diffs.
    Furthermore, we pay 16 bytes in every LclVarDsc (out of 88) for bookkeeping purposes for this pass, even in MinOpts.
