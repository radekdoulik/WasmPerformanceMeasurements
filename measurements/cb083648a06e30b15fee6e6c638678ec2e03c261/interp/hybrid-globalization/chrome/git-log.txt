    Crossgen2 support for static virtual method resolution (take 2) (#87438)
    
    This change adds SVM resolution support to Crossgen2. We still resort to
    runtime JIT in case we cannot resolve the SVM call at compile time (typically for
    canonical generic methods); some of these cases are just due to current limitations
    of the JIT interface and can be fixed in the future.
    
    Thanks
