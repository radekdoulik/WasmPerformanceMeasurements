    [mono][sgen] Fix GetTotalMemory (#84480)
    
    The previous code was iterating over all blocks, and their freelist, without checking if the block has been swept in the first place. This would lead to incorrect size computation if the block wasn't swept and undefined behavior when racing with concurrent sweep.
