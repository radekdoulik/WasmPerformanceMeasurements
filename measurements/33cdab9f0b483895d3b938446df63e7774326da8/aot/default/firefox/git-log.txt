    Update analyzer to use FeatureGuardAttribute (#99340)
    
    This replaces FeatureCheckAttribute with FeatureGuardAttribute in the
    form that was approved in API review.
    
    Removes FeatureDependsOnAttribute and replaces it with
    FeatureGuardAttribute on the property. Since it is not allowed on
    types, feature requirements must be "bubbled up" to the guard
    property, so the tests are updated to do so.
