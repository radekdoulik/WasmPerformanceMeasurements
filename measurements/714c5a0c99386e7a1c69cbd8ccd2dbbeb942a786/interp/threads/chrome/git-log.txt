    JIT: fix inliner profile consistency computation (#109714)
    
    It's possible for the JIT to inline a profiled inlinee into an unprofiled context, and then have a subsequent inline fold a profiled branch. If so we may see a case where the folded edges don't have profile information.
    
    Tolerate this.
    
    Fixes #109657
    
    Re-morphing of a statement during early-prop may mistakenly believe it has altered the flow graph and so invalidates DFS. Value numbering is not set up to handle this and crashes. Since this seems like a rare occurrence, have morph detect if it has really changed the flowgraph and avoid invalidating the DFS when it hasn't.
    
    Fixes #109730
