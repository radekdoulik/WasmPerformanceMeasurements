    Fix an edge case in the Tarjan GC bridge that leads to losing xref information (#112825)
    
    * Fix an edge case in the Tarjan SCC that lead to losing xref information
    
    In the Tarjan SCC bridge processing there's a color graph used to find out
    connections between SCCs. There was a rare case which only manifested when
    a cycle in the object graph points to another cycle that points to a bridge
    object. We only recognized direct bridge pointers but not pointers to other
    non-bridge SCCs that in turn point to bridges and where we already calculated
    the xrefs. These xrefs were then lost.
    
    * Add test case to sgen-bridge-pathologies and add an assert to catch the original bug
    
    * Add review
