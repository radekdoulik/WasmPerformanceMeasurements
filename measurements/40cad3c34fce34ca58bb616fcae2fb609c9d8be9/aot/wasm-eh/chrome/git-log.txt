    JIT: Generalize assignment decomposition in physical promotion (#85323)
    
    Generalize assignment decomposition to handle arbitrary combinations of
    physically promoted structs. Do this by introducing a DecompositionPlan
    class that keeps track of the copies to do that involve replacement
    fields. The first step is then to fill out this plan. In the general
    case where both the source and destination are physically promoted this
    involves iterating the replacements in lockstep. For promotions that map
    exactly, a direct copy between their locals is queued into the plan; in
    other cases (e.g. partial overlap) it may involve writing the source
    back to the struct local.
    
    The plan is used to generate the IR and to figure out the best strategy to
    use for the remaining parts of the struct. Additional it is used to check for
    some optimization opportunities (e.g. we avoid superfluous write barriers
    in some cases).
