    Process incoming frames before sending frames for Http2Connection. (#73307)
    
    * Process incoming frames before sending frames for Http2Connection.
    
    Moves the ProcessIncomingFramesAsync method before sending the preface.
    This fixes a deadlock when using a NamedPipe as a transport where
    incoming frames need to be read before being able to write.
    Also rename _expectingSettingsAck to _receivedSettingsAck to clearly
    specify that the settings frame has being received.
    
    Fix #73097
