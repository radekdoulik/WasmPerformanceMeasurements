    Fix DiagnosticSource to work with NativeAOT (#76109)
    
    * Fix DiagnosticSource to work with NativeAOT
    
    There were 2 problems:
    
    1. The use of MakeGenericType doesn't work when a property is a ValueType.
    An app will crash when a listener is enabled and DiagnosticSourceEventSource tries
    writing values.
    2. The properties on KeyValuePair were not being preserved correctly, so the Arguments
    of the DiagnosticSourceEventSource methods were not being serialized correctly.
    
    Add test (and infrastructure) to ensure DiagnosticSource works in a NativeAOT app
    
    Fix #75945
    
    * Enable new NativeAotTests in CI
    
    - Only run them in Release configuration
    - Suppress IL2026 warning
    
    * Don't run NativeAot published app tests on OSX since it isn't supported
    
    Set EventSourceSupport only on the projects that need it.
