    Allow nested types inside of the <Module> type (#111435)
    
    * Allow nested types inside of the <Module> type
    - This isn't disallowed by spec, although ilasm and ildasm cannot handle these cases
    - Simply skip adding the type to the available class hash.
    
    * Fix issue where TokenFromRid parameters are out of order in a number of places in the runtime
    
    Fix #111164
