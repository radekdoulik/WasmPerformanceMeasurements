    JIT: boost inlining for methods that may return small arrays (#114806)
    
    Look for inlinees that may be allocating and returning small fixed sized arrays.
    When inlined, these array allocations may end up non-escaping and be stack allocated.
    
    This analysis is approximate; we can't tell for sure in the IL scan what the array
    size is, and we can't easily tell if the allocated array is actually returned.
    
    Contributes to #113236
