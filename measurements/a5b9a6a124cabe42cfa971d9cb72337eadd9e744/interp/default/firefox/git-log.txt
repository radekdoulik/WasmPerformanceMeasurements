    Fix exception interception on ARM64 with new EH (#100349)
    
    The interception stack frame was originally set to the caller SP on arm64,
    but the checks in CallCatchFunclet and ExInfo::PopExInfos were using the
    current frame SP instead. This change sets the interception frame to
    the current frame SP on arm/arm64 too to fix the issue.
