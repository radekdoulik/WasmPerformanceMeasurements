    ILLink: Don't mark attributes from MarkEntireType (#108552)
    
    Attributes are already marked from MarkType, called by MarkEntireType.
    The removed marking logic was using the assembly as the warning
    message origin, making these warnings hard to suppress (in
    addition to being redundant with the warnings at the type level).
