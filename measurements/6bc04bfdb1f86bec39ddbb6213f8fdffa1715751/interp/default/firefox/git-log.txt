    JIT: empty array enumerator opt (#109237)
    
    For empty arrays, `GetEnumerator` returns a static instance rather
    than a new instance. This hinders the JIT's ability to optimize when
    it is able to stack allocate the new instance.
    
    Detect when a stack allocation comes from an array `GetEnumerator`
    and fold the branch in the inlined enumerator method to always take
    the new instance path (since it is now cheap, allocation free, and
    is functionally equivalent).
    
    Contributes to #108913.
