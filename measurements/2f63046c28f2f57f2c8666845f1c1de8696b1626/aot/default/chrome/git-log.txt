    JIT: Validate loop invariant base case as part of IV analysis (#97122)
    
    Move the validation of the base case of the IV analysis into
    `FlowGraphNaturalLoop::AnalyzeIteration`. Previously the validation for
    the base case was left up to the users:
    
    - Loop cloning tried to accomplish this by checking whether loop
      inversion had run, but this is not sufficient (#96623) as nothing
      guarantees the loop is dominated by the inverted test. Loop cloning
      also skipped the check entirely for GDV, leading to #95315.
    
    - Unrolling completely neglected to check the condition leading to
      #96591. Furthermore, unrolling made implicit assumptions that any
      `BBJ_COND` init block was an inverted test and downright removed the
      condition without any checks. This also led to another issue #97040
      where unrolling could uncover new natural loops that had not been
      canonicalized.
    
    This change makes `FlowGraphNaturalLoop::AnalyzeIteration` try to prove
    that the loop invariant it returns is true in the base case as well as
    being maintained by the loop. If it cannot prove this then it fails.
    This fixes all the issues, but sadly uncovers that we were doing a lot
    of cloning in OSR methods without actually proving legality. We no
    longer clone in these cases, but we can look into what to do about them
    separately.
