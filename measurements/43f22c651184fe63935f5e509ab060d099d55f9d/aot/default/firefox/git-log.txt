    Always pass LoaderAllocator when creating Assembly (#107643)
    
    We are currently conditionally passing the `LoaderAllocator` to initialize the `Assembly` based on whether it is collectible and then having the initialization explicitly get the global one if it was null. When we create the `Assembly`, we already have the appropriate loader allocator (global loader allocator for non-collectible, corresponding assembly loader allocator for collectible), so just create the `Assembly` with it.
