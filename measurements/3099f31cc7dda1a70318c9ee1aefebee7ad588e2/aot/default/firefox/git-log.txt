    Delete -fms-extensions from coreclr native build (#102834)
    
    For stdcpp conformance, remove the remaining special extensions.
    * clean up unnecessary __llvm  special handling.
    * Add class, enum, struct prefixes to cases where the variable name is clashing with type name and it changes meaning  (-Werror=changes-meaning)
      * In some trivial cases, I just renamed the variables..
    * On x86, replace `__asm {}` syntax with `__asm ("")`
    * Two small illumos related build fixes under `src/native` which helped validating the rest of the changes on the platform.
