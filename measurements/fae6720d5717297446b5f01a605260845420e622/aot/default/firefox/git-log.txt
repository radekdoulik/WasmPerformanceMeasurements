    Send connection WINDOW_UPDATE before RTT PING (#97881)
    
    Some servers in GCP have a non-standard ping accounting mechanism, meaning they reset their unsolicited PING counter when they receive DATA, HEADERS or WINDOW_UPDATE. To comply with this behavior, this PR adjusts the RTT logic ensuring that a connection WINDOW_UPDATE is being sent out before we send an RTT PING by applying two changes:
    
    - Swap the order of the normal connection WINDOW_UPDATE we attempt after every DATA frame received and the sending of the RTT PING so WINDOW_UPDATE goes first.
    - In case we need to send an RTT PING, and we didn't send a normal connection WINDOW_UPDATE (threshold not reached), send a WINDOW_UPDATE anyways with current _pendingWindowUpdate credits. Do not send a PING if this is not possible (_pendingWindowUpdate == 0). Just like RTT PINGs, such WINDOW_UPDATEs are relatively rare and should not hurt performance.
