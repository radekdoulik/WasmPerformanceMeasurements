    Make host tests use single copy of shared framework (#100588)
    
    - Only create one .NET install layout to be shared by all host tests
    -  Add `pretest.proj` for `host.pretest` subset that builds all test project assets and creates the single .NET install layout
    - Fix `NativeHostApis` tests that were editing the .NET install layout directly (instead of creating a copy to edit)
      - Remove some unnecessary copying/creating of SDKs and frameworks by sharing the fixture across tests
    - Update host testing doc with simpler setup instructions and more details around investigating test failures
