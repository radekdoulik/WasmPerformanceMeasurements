    JIT: Use any reaching def for unreachable uses in incremental SSA builder (#110077)
    
    There really is no correct reaching definition in this case, so any reaching
    definition will do here. This matches what happens normally in the JIT when
    various phases optimize control flow after SSA has been built without removing
    the now-unreachable blocks.
    
    Also give unreachable stores an SSA number.
    
    Fix #109971
