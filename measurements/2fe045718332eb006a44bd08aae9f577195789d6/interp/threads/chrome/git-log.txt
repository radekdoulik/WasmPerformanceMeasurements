    JIT: Consider conditionally executed loop statements for hoisting (#117829)
    
    Fixes the roughly 10x regression in #116486. This quirks loop hoisting to iterate all loop blocks, and consider hoisting expensive statements even if they don't execute every iteration. The `(IND_COST_EX * 16)` cutoff was chosen to minimize churn, while still solving the above regression.
