    SPMI: Fix recGetStaticFieldCurrentClass (#83843)
    
    getStaticFieldCurrentClass has very different behavior depending on
    whether pIsSpeculative is passed or not, and we need to record the
    resulting class handle in both cases.
    
    This fixes a case of replays not working after recording that I hit
    while tracking down a separate issue.
