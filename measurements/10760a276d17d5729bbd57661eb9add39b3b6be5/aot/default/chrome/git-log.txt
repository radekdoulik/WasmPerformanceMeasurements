    ZipArchive: Improve performance of removing extra fields (#108665)
    
    This improves the performance of removing extra fields in the ZipArchive by optimizing the removal process.
    
    `src/libraries/System.IO.Compression/src/System/IO/Compression/ZipBlocks.cs`: Replaced multiple iterations and list operations with a single `RemoveAll` call to enhance efficiency.
