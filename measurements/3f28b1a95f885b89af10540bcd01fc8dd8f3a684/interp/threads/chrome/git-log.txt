    Move tools to use LKG ILC (#107772)
    
    Starts with crossgen2 and moves shared helpers into a central targets file.
    
    This still leaves a significant amount of work to do. We're still building 3 copies of the crossgen2 and ILC projects (plain, in-build, and AOT) and not all might be necessary. Also, some pieces could maybe be reused in other portions of the build.
    
    There's also no way to _not_ use LKG bits. That's left as future work.
