    JIT: Consolidate block scaling logic (#99234)
    
    Currently we synthetically set block weights in two different places
    1. Before finding loops we set weights for exceptional blocks and blocks
       that do not dominate all returns
    2. After finding loops we set weights for lexical ranges containing
       backedges
    
    Both of these make use of dominance and reachability information, which
    means that we often need to recompute this information after finding
    loops.
    
    This PR consolidates both scaling passes to happen after the main loop
    finding. This makes it so that we only need to compute reachability and
    dominance information once. Hence, some TP improvements are expected.
    
    Diffs expected because we now mark general loop heads after loop
    finding, which results in more general loop heads found due to
    blocks inserted by loop canonicalization. This results in PerfScore
    regressions.
