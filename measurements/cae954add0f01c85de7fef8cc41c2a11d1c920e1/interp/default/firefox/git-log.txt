    Fix JitDoSsa=0 (#71789)
    
    If we don't do SSA, we don't do liveness, but Lowering depends on
    liveness-created lvDoNotEnregister, so if we're not doing SSA,
    at least run local var liveness. Note that in the MinOpts case,
    `lvSetMinOptsDoNotEnreg()` sets all locals to do-not-enregister.
    
    Fixes #62251
