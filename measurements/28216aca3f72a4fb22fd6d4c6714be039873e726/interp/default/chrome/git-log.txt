    Add tracing to `hostpolicy_init_t::init` (#118973)
    
    We're hitting an intermittent crash in CI on macOS x64. Without a dump, we just have the trace messages to narrow down where it is happening - seems to be between the start of `hostpolicy_init_t::init` (called by `corehost_load`) and when `corehost_main` is called (right after `corehost_load`). This adds a bunch of tracing to `hostpolicy_init_t::init` (can be removed when we figure out what is going on and where).
