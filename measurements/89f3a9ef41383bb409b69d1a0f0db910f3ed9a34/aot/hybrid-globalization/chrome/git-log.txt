    Fixes and improvements: (#87218)
    
    - Fix hang bug caused by race condition in change_heap_count
    - Change way we store dynamic heap input metrics to make it easier to surface them via ETW events.
    - Refactor enter_spin_lock_msl into an inlineable part and a slower, more complex out-of-line part.
    - Subtract time spent in safe_switch_to_thread and WiatLongerNoInstru from msl wait time - this makes this metric much less noisy.
    - add more diagnostic output to check_heap_count and change_heap_count.
    - add more spinning to EnterFinalizeLock to address slow suspensions in some ASP.NET benchmarks.
