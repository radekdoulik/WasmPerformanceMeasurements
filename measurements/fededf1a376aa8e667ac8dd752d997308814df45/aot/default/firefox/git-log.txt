    Don't use Newtonsoft.Json as a test dependency name in ResolveComponentDependencies host test. (#71946)
    
    Use a made up generic name in a test dependency. Using a valid NuGet package name can trigger repo-wide checks for stale versions of dependencies.
    
    In the case of this test it's just a name, the test actually doesn't use the binary (it makes up an empty file with that name).
