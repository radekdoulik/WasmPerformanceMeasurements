    Reuse x86 GC and unwinding code in NativeAOT (#99109)
    
    * Verbatim code extraction from eetwain.cpp into gc_unwind_x86.inl
    
    * Reuse x86 GC and unwinding code in NativeAOT
    
    Extracts x86 unwinding code and EnumGCRefs from eetwain.h/cpp into
    gc_unwind_x86.h/inl files. The bulk of the code remains unchanged
    with the methods UnwindStackFrameX86 and EnumGcRefsX86 extracted
    from the original EECodeManager methods.
    
    CoffNativeCodeManager includes all the x86 GC decoders and includes
    gc_unwind_x86.inl for TARGET_X86. Missing methods are implemented
    in terms of UnwindStackFrameX86, EnumGcRefsX86, and DecodeGCHdrInfo.
    
    Funclet calling assembly helpers are fixed up to follow the same
    pattern as on other platform.
    
    * Remove assert
