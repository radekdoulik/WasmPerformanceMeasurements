    Implement test checking whether CET is active (#71509)
    
    As part of Control Flow Enforcement Technology (CET) testing we need
    to make sure that CET is actually active on the execution machines;
    otherwise subtle infra changes could easily regress the testing by
    inadvertently deactivating CET without anyone noticing. This change
    introduces an initial CET availability test for this purpose.
    
    Thanks
