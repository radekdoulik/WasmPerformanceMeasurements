    Couple fixes to scanning fields (#102649)
    
    Found in the pri1 suite:
    
    * Accessing literal fields from IL is invalid. We throw an exception in JitInterface, but we didn't scan the exception type.
    * Allow RVA statics on generics with a cctor. Leftover from https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/86081#discussion_r1190647469. Looks like we have a test.
