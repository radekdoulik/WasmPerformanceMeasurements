    JIT: Disallow SCEV analysis of non-values (#108603)
    
    SCEV analysis would allow stores either via simple add-rec handling or
    by forwarding to the data of the store. Given that stores are not values
    this is odd behavior that has bitten me while consuming the analysis
    package.
    
    Switch the analysis to return nullptr for stores; instead add handling
    for `GT_PHI` in the places where it was needed.
