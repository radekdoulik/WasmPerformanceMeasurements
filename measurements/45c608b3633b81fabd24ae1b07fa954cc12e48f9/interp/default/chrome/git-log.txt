    Keep metadata for rooted members in ILLink (#102850)
    
    ILLink wasn't keeping metadata (specifically parameter names) for
    rooted members, whether rooted as:
    - part of a root assembly
    - by a root descriptor XML.
    - by DebuggerDisplayAttribute/DebuggerTypeProxyAttribute
    
    This ensures all of those mark members visible to reflection so
    that method parameter names are kept.
