    Fix createdump 'stack smashing detected' error on arm64 (#108166)
    
    The changes from PR #91865 were reverted by PR #95433.
    
    This change restores the fix from PR #91865 by changing the size back to SpecialDiagInfoSize
    but uses the 4 parameter MemoryRegion constructor that doesn't assert the address/size is on
    a PAGE_SIZE alignment (PR #95433).
