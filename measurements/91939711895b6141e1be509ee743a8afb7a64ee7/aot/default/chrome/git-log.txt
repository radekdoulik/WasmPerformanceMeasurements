    Fix ifdef for RawArrayData in NativeAOT Runtime.Base. (#109494)
    
    The `BIT64` preprocessor symbol is not defined nor used anywhere in this
    repository. This means that if you were to compile a Runtime.Base assembly
    for 64-bit, helpers like `RhpLdelemaRef` would calculate an incorrect address.
    
    This PR fixes the problem by using the `TARGET_64BIT` preprossor directive
    instead. Just like the System.Private.CoreLib version of this class.
