    Add test coverage for DirectoryServices.TransformControls (#107201)
    
    * Added tests for server response DirectoryControls
    
    * Addressing platform inconsistencies
    
    * There are looser rules in OpenLDAP when an octet string exceeds the length of its containing sequence.
    * Windows 8.1 and below treats trailing 0x80 bytes differently to every other platform.
    * Added a test which covers an octet string containing invalid Unicode bytes.
    
    * Handle differing .NET Framework behaviour
    
    Also handle changes to the "a" format string: Winldap in Windows 10 is stricter when a SEQUENCE's contents overflow its length
    
    * Update SortResponseControlTests.cs
