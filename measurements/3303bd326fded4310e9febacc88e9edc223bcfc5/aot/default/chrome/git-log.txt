    Fail-fast on SuspendThread/ResumeThread failures (#75845)
    
    - They would fail typically if the handle is invalid (perhaps because it was erroneously closed, or it's not a thread handle).
    - In the places where they are called the handle should be a valid thread handle. Failures can lead to less desirable behaviors, like a deadlock. Added and used `ClrSuspendThread` and `ClrResumeThread` instead, which check for errors and fail-fast.
