    JIT: fix count reconstruction problem (#100385)
    
    In large methods with lots of irreducible loops we may find
    reconstructed counts reaching very large values.
    
    Since profile counts in practice won't ever be much larger than say
    10^12, detect when reconstructed counts exceed this value, and stop
    the algorithm.
    
    We may eventually decide to rerun in "hard blend" mode where we
    intentionally limit the edge likelihood ranges. But this should do for
    now.
    
    Closes #100350.
