    Switch from arm64 biarch image to Azure Linux image (#101946)
    
    The biarch image is currently unused in our ci builds.
    
    Use of the biarch image was added in
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/91019 but the job that
    used it was disabled for arm64 in
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/92057. https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/90427
    tracks adding back the arm64 jobs.
    
    The arm64 fullaot job was added in
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/55362 which explains:
    
    > We don't ship any products using FullAOT on Linux x64/arm64, but this
    compilation mode is used for iOS, FullAOT-related issues that affect iOS are
    likely to be caught by FullAOT on Linux x64/arm64, and it is a lot easier to
    build, develop, and debug on desktop OSes.
    
    If the arm64 job is enabled again in the future, it should be
    made to use a new entry in `pipeline-with-resources.yml`, instead
    of modifying the image used for all other linux_arm64 jobs.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/101707
