    Fix some incorrect SpecialFolder entries for Unix (#68610)
    
    * Fix incorrect SpecialFolder entries for Unix
    
    This fixes an incorrect Documents/Personal for Linux+Mac entry,
    incorrect Videos Mac entry,
    and an incorrect (Local) ApplicationData Mac entry.
    
    Fix #63214
    
    * Don't make Unix tests assume Personal is Home
    
    * Use the same value for Mac's (Local)ApplicationData
    
    * Use NSPaths for OSX Special Folder
    
    The Apple documentation recommends to use these instead of hardcoding the paths, so the paths that had NSPath equivalents have been replaced.
    
    * Change System.Native CMakeLists to include OSX for SearchPath
    
    `a17e73466ca639388a3d89f4d6be0ab9703802fc` made OSX call the native NSearchPath functions, however a stub was initially called. This fixes it to call the native functions.
