    [wasm] Add the illink substitutions for SIMD (#79672)
    
    This should fix size regression introduce with https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/78068
    
    The untrimmed S.N.Vector class added few kilobytes to the assemblies
    of the bench sample. That wasn't that bad, OTOH the code produced
    by the aot compiler was much larger, 5MB in this case.
    
    So this will case default non-SIMD case. In the case of SIMD build we
    will need more investigation.
