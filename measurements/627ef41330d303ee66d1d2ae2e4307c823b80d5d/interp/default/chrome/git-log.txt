    JIT: Fold `(x + c1) + c2` in lowering (#108779)
    
    This transformation already exists in morph, but this duplicates the
    transformation in lowering to facilitate removing the call to morph from
    CSE. This transformation happening after CSE is somewhat important
    because shared constant CSE can introduce this IR shape.
