    Avoid LINQ expressions in getting `GetService` (#100916)
    
    This makes ASP.NET 50 kB smaller with native AOT.
    
    We don't even need this `MethodInfo` but it's created in the static constructor along with other things that are needed so can't get rid of it. Could move it to a different type to get it fully out of the way.
    
    Note: this was previously grabbing `MethodInfo` of the lambda but that might have been unintentional.
