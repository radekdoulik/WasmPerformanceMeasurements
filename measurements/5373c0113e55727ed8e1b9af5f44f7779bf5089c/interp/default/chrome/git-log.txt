    [wasm] Fix bugs related to jiterpreter heuristic (#99273)
    
    * Fix bugs related to jiterpreter heuristic:
      - VALUE_ABORT_OUTSIDE_BRANCH_BLOCK_NONE was ignored, causing the heuristic to reject good traces
      - Instruction counting was using basic blocks' in-count instead of their actual instruction count
      - When two basic blocks were merged, their jiterpreter data (backwards branch target and contains call flags) were not merged
    * Fix jiterpreter opcode insertion not updating the estimated native offset of opcodes (this would result in weird asserts randomly occurring in sufficiently large methods)
    * Fix jiterpreter being unable to compile a backward branch that targeted the trace's prepare/enter opcode, since it was not "inside" the trace
    * Enable more jiterpreter diagnostics when a method is verbose according to the interpreter
    * Add better diagnostic messages for a few failure scenarios
