    Harden UnixPkcs12Reader native memory usage
    
    * Do not do the allocation and parsing in the constructor, since throwing there prevents Dispose from running
    * If something goes wrong between AllocHGlobal and moving the pointer into a PointerMemoryManager, call FreeHGlobal.
        * Past that point it will be correctly freed by Dispose.
    * Switch from AllocHGlobal/FreeHGlobal to NativeMemory.Alloc/Free
    * Harden the Dispose method against mid-execution failure.
