    [mono] Optimize mono_metadata_decode_row_col_raw (#99939)
    
    The loop in this function is somewhat expensive, and in some wasm startup profiles I did we spent around 1% of cpu time inside it. From some quick tests this seems to make it a little bit faster, at the price of 9 bytes per MonoTableInfo (~500 bytes per assembly), which I think is worth it.
