    Disable CoreCLR interpreter test for JIT stress (#116219)
    
    There is a problem in the interpreter when handling calls to code that
    doesn't have native code yet, but that has precode already. The call to
    MethodDesc::PrepareInitialCode triggers an assert down its call chain
    due to the prestub existence.
    
    This change disables running the interpreter test with JIT stress until
    the problem is solved.
