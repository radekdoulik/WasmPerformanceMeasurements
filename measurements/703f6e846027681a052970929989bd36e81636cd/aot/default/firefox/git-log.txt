    JIT: Fix rich debug info reporting with failed inline contexts (#98755)
    
    The child/sibling link ordinals would be reported as 0 in cases where
    the immediate child/sibling was a failed one. This would break the
    reported tree structure.
    
    Also add some JITDUMP logging of the reported info.
