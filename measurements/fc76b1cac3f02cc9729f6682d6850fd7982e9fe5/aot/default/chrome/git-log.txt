    Fix some TensorPrimitives tests failing for me locally with checked builds (#101745)
    
    This is just:
    - Adding tolerance checks for NFloat that are the same as for float/double
    - Adding tolerance for MultiplyAddEstimate that matches our other tolerances for "Estimate" functions
    
    This addresses everything failing for me locally, but it doesn't match the failure spike recently highlighted in CI.
