    JIT: Modify switch and finally-ret successors using edge redirection helpers (#117102)
    
    Follow-up to #116933. By mutating the existing edge during switch successor modifications, we can avoid invalidating the unique switch successor map. Also adds a helper for removing edges from the switch successor map without needing to trash the whole entry. I'd like to get to a point where we always have accurate switch successor sets available -- we could even consider rearchitecting BBswtDesc to model BBehfDesc and hold unique successor edges.
