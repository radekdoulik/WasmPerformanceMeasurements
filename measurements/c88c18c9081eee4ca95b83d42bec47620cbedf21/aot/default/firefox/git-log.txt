    Don't copy XUnit runner to output for local builds (#106721)
    
    * Don't copy runner to test output during regular builds (#96826)
    
    * Don't copy runner to test output during regular builds
    
    The test runner is not required for local test execution, but is needed
    for helix (today).  In the future we should try to change helix to not
    expect the runner in the output directory, but instead as a correlation
    payload.
    
    * Refine xunit 1651 workaround until we can pick up the fix
    
    * Update eng/testing/xunit/xunit.console.targets
