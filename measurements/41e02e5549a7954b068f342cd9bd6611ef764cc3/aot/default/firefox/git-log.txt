    Remove class constraint from Interlocked.{Compare}Exchange (#104558)
    
    * Remove class constraint from Interlocked.{Compare}Exchange
    
    Today `Interlocked.CompareExchange<T>` and `Interlocked.Exchange<T>` support only reference type `T`s. Now that we have corresponding {Compare}Exchange methods that support types of size 1, 2, 4, and 8, we can remove the constraint and support any `T` that's either a reference type, a primitive type, or an enum type, making the generic overload more useful and avoiding consumers needing to choose less-than-ideal types just because of the need for atomicity with Interlocked.{Compare}Exchange.
