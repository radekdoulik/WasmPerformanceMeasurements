    Fix LoaderAllocator of DynamicMethodTable (#111038)
    
    * Fix LoaderAllocator of DynamicMethodTable
    
    There is one `DynamicMethodTable` allocated per `Module` if needed. When its
    instance is being created, an incorrect `LoaderAllocator` is passed to the
    `CreateMinimalMethodTable` function. Instead of the `Module`'s
    `LoaderAllocator`, it passes in the default one.
    That fires an assert in non-release builds of the runtime and it results in
    incorrect marking of the `MethodTable` as not collectible in case the `Module`'s
    LoaderAllocator is collectible.
    
    This change fixes it by passing in the `LoaderAllocator` of the module
    instead.
