    Fix shadow stack handling during exception handling (#103047)
    
    The shadow stack pointer was not updated when resuming execution after a
    catch handler. That was causing stack overflow crashes in some of the
    coreclr tests when running with CET enabled.
    
    This change adds proper updating of the shadow stack pointer in a similar
    way to what RtlRestoreContext does.
