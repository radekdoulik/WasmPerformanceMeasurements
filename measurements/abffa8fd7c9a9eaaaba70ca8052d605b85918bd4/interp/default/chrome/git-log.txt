    ObjWriter in C# (#95876)
    
    This is reimplementation of NativeAOT ObjWriter in pure C# instead of depending on LLVM. It implements Mach-O, ELF, COFF object file emitter with DWARF and CodeView debugging information. Only x64 and arm64 targets are implemented to cover officially supported platforms (win-x86 code is present and lightly tested; linux-x86 code is present and incomplete, only serves as a test bed for emitting 32-bit ELF files if we ever need that).
    
    Original object writer code is still present and can be used by setting the `DOTNET_USE_LLVM_OBJWRITER=1` environment variable.
    
    **Thanks to @am11 for helping with testing and debugging this, @xoofx for making LibObjectFile which helped kickstart this project, @PaulusParssinen for tips about branchless U/SLEB128 size calculation, and all the people on the .NET team who helped push this forward!**
    
    Fixes #77178
