    [wasm] Move some defaults out of the templates (#72626)
    
    * Move some defaults out of the template
    * Fix build for template tests, and satellite assembly tests
    
    - Running with `node` fails when relinking, or AOT'ing in Debug config
    - this seems to be when linking is done with `-O0`
      - it seems to work fine with emsdk `3.1.7` though
      - For `Debug` config we automatically set `_WasmDevel=true`, which
      then sets `-O0`
    
      - This is not seen on CI, since we don't run non-template tests in
      `Debug`. But for local runs, we do.
      - The template tests are explicitly run for Debug, and Release, and
      they break because of this
      - So, setting `_WasmDevel=false` for now, till this gets fixed
    
    - Also, set `OutputType=Exe` in the project file itself, so it gets set
    before `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` gets imported, or early enough.
    
    * Wasm.Build.Tests: add relinking tests for templates
    
    * Revert unintended change
    
    * Fix WasmTemplateTests on windows
    
    * Wasm.Build.Tests: Explicitly allow web server port in chrome, on windows
