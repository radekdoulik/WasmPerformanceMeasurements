    Remove helper method frames from Monitors (#113242)
    
    - Convert to the FCALL fast path/QCALL slow path approach
    - Make EnterHelperResult/LeaveHelperAction into enum class so that they can safely be silently marshaled between native and managed
    - Move the lockTaken flag handling to managed code so we can share more helpers
    
    Benchmarking indicates this may actually be faster than the previous approach. I'm a bit skeptical, but its not out of the question.
