    [cdac-build-tool] don't embed resources (#108293)
    
    reviously we used EmbeddedResource to collect the contract descriptor baselines into cdac-build-tool and we also embedded the C source template.
    
    But we only ever run cdac-build-tool during the runtime build - the files are in the same source tree. Just pass their paths when invoking the tool, don't embed them.
    
    Fixes #107958
    
    * don't embed baselines into cdac-build-tool
    
    * don't embed the template source file in the tool
