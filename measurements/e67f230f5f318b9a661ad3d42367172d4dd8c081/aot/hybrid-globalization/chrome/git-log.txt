    ILLink: Avoid warning for RUC field rooted as part of a root assembly (#108498)
    
    Similar to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/81864, fields
    in a RUC class are producing trim analysis warnings in the OOB
    trim step (the mentioned issue was specific to library mode, but
    it's also a problem for the normal root assembly mode).
    
    This extends the fix from
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/84620 to avoid producing
    warnings for fields that are marked just because an assembly was
    rooted. Arguably rooting an assembly _should_ warn about rooted
    RUC members, but that's not the case today for RUC methods, so
    this makes the behavior consistent for fields.
