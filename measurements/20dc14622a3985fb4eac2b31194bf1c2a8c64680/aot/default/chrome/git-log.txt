    Fix calling convention mismatch in GC callouts (#110685)
    
    Fixes #110607.
    
    The native side expected fastcall, managed side didn't.
    
    Filed #110684 on the test hole. We would have caught it during x86 bringup if this had _any_ tests since this is a guaranteed stack corruption and crash.
