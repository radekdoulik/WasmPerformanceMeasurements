    Ensure Array.CreateInstance for reference types works (#101048)
    
    Follow up to #100626. The original fix only worked for unoptimized builds because the list of templates doesn't survive from scanning phase (when we do dataflow) to codegen phase (when we no longer do dataflow).
    
    The test that this was supposed to fix is still failing in #100331.
