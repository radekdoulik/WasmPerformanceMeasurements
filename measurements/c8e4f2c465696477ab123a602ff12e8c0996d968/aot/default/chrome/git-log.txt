    [NativeAOT] Adding CET support (#102680)
    
    * Add support for STATUS_RETURN_ADDRESS_HIJACK_ATTEMPT
    
    * fix build with clang
    
    * Allow hijacked returns that land in assembly thunks
    
    * fix x86 build
    
    * fail fast if hijack is hit on an unhijacked thread.
    
    * comment
    
    * assert that OS unhijacked the thread to the same target as stashed by us.
    
    * opt into CETCOMPAT by default
    
    * unify adjustment for thunks
    
    * Use CETCompat as condition. Narrow to x64.
    
    * Enable EHCONT, if CET and CFG are enabled
    
    * tweak comments
    
    * Reconcile shadow stack with SP changes in RhpCallCatchFunclet
    
    * Use RhFailFast for failfast
    
    * drop __fastcall in HijackFunc
    
    * Apply suggestions from code review
