    Fix handling of loop alignment targets (#97367)
    
    * Fix handling of loop alignment targets
    
    Now that `BBJ_COND` block false target is not necessarily
    fall-through, the loop alignment code needs to consider the
    false target as what induces a loop via a false target
    back edge.
    
    Also, stop marking blocks after possible loop back edges for
    aligned loops as needing labels; they do not need to be so marked.
    
    * Restore setting label on BasicBlock after setting `igLoopBackEdge`
    
    This minimizes the size of an aligned loop by `getLoopSize`.
    
    Also, add `superpmi.py asmdiffs --alignloops` argument to allow
    specifying that you want to run asmdiffs with loop alignment enabled.
    By default, asmdiffs is done with loop alignment disabled, to avoid
    too many extraneous diffs.
