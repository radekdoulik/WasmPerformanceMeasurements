    JIT: Don't set patchpoints in methods with CORINFO_DEBUG_CODE (#88227)
    
    In #88199 the debugger is overriding some jit flags, but has left other flags set
    that confuse the jit: both `TIER0` and `DEBUG_CODE` end uip set so one part of the jit
    used logic appropriate for `TIER0` and another part did not.
    
    The JIT ended up creating a patchpoint for OSR in a method with localloc and this
    combination is not supported by OSR and lead to a crash.
    
    Harden the jit so if the runtime asks for debuggable code, the jit will never
    generate patchpoints.
