    JIT: Remove IV analysis quirk in loop cloning (#96563)
    
    Fix a bug in `FlowGraphNaturalLoop::MatchLimit`; it did not properly check limit
    locals for address exposure when evaluating their invariance (the old logic does
    that). Also support promoted struct fields (like the old logic).
    
    No diffs expected -- the diffs of the quirk here were coming from this bug in
    `FlowGraphNaturalLoop::MatchLimit`.
