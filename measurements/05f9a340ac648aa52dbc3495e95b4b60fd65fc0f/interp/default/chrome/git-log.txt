    Implement ICollection<T> on ToLookup (#98895)
    
    LINQ's ToLookup returns an ILookup. The object we return today on some platforms implements `IIListProvider`. Instead, we can just have the returned object always implement `ICollection<T>`. The provided CopyTo then enables the default ToArray/ToList implementations to still be efficient. Implementing ICollection enables other uses to also take advantage of implementations like CopyTo and Count.
    
    As `Lookup<TKey, TElement>` is public, this doesn't implement the interface on that type and instead derives a sealed internal type that provides the interface implementation (which is minimal). If we want to augment the public API, we could do so subsequently and delete the internal derived type.
