    Make longjmp over managed frames work (#111259)
    
    * Make longjmp over managed frames work
    
    The new exception handling has broken hosting Lua on Windows when
    a Lua code throws an exception that ends up crossing managed frames.
    Lua uses longjmp for its exception handling mechanism and the new
    exception handling reported the longjmp as an unhandled `SEHException`.
    
    This change makes the new EH behave like the legacy one w.r.t. the longjmp propagation over managed frames on Windows. It is a best effort fix though just to get rid of the regression related to the legacy exception handling. New code should not rely on this. And it doesn't work on non-windows targets (neither did it work with the legacy exception handling).
