    JIT: Add basic support for Swift reverse pinvokes (#100018)
    
    Adds very rudimentary support for Swift reverse pinvokes. Since Swift function
    pointers are based on `SwiftSelf` also adds basic support for the `SwiftSelf`
    parameter. Structs are not supported yet, and neither is `SwiftError`.
    
    Adds 10 simple tests just so that we have something. These will be regenerated
    (with a larger number of probably 100 tests) once we have the struct support.
    
    The `SwiftSelf` parameter is not enregisterable because it is passed in a
    register that `genFnPrologCalleeRegArgs` does not handle. In the future this
    function should be rewritten to support this register, but there are plans to
    rewrite it to handle float and integer registers simultaneously, so that work
    can happen at that time.
