    Narrow AddressFamily passed to getaddrinfo when IPv6 is unsupported (#112642)
    
    When IPv6 is unsupported or disabled, we should avoid passing `AF_UNSPEC` to the platform calls since those will do `AAAA` resolve attempts which might result in failures surfacing to the user, see #107979. Instead, we can narrow down the query to `AF_INET` so failures are avoided.
    
    The change has been validated by packet captures on Windows and Linux. There are no `AAAA` questions when `System.Net.DisableIPv6` is set to `true`.
