    Use SRM's TypeName parser in ILLink (#103740)
    
    This replaces the type name parser we copied from corert with the one
    in System.Reflection.Metadata.
    
    Adds a test for resolving escaped type names, shared by ILLink and
    Native AOT. To support this testcase, the test infra also uses
    TypeNameResolver. The ILLink tests use it via IVT, and the Native AOT
    tests use it by including source files. The sources have been factored
    a little to make it possible to use just the TypeNameResolver from
    NativeAot without pulling in other components of ILLink.
