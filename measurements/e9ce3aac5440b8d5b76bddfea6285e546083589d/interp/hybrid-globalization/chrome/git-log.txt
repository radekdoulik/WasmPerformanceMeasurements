    JIT: Add a head merging transformation alongside the tail merging transformation (#90468)
    
    Add a pass that does head merging to compliment the existing tail
    merging pass. Unlike tail merging this requires reordering the first
    statement with the terminator node of the predecessor, which requires
    some interference checking.
    
    The head merging is enabled only for BBJ_COND since the CQ benefit
    for enabling it more generally does not seem to pay off. Additionally
    we mainly try to target the IR produced by the importer due to spill
    cliques, which usually happen with the IL that results from using
    ternaries.
    
    Fix #90017
