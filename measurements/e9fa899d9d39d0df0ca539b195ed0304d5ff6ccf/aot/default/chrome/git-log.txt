    Add comments to host error_codes.h (#107775)
    
    Include basic descriptions of host error codes in `error_codes.h`. Slight clean-up (and some renames) of some error codes - these are all failures with no expected programmatic recovery, so the value change should be fine:
    - Merged `LibHostCurExeFindFailure` with `CurrentHostFindFailure`
    - Merged `LibHostSdkFindFailure` with `SdkResolveFailure`
    - Merged `LibHostUnknownCommand` with `LibHostInvalidArgs`
