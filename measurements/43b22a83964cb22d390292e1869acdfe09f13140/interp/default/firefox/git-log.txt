    [cdac] Implement a JSON contract reader (#100966)
    
    Implement a parser for the "compact" JSON contract descriptor format specified in [data_contracts.md](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/design/datacontracts/data_descriptor.md)
    
    The data model is a WIP - it's likely we will want something a bit more abstract (and less mutable).
    
    This is not wired up to consume a real contract descriptor from target process memory at the moment.  It's only exercised by unit tests for now.
    
    ---
    
    * compact descriptor format json parser
    
    * suggestions from reviews; remove FieldDescriptor wrong conversion
    
       we incorrectly allowed `[number]` as a field descriptor conversion. that's not allowed.  removed it.
    
    * Make test project like the nativeoat+linker tests
    
       Dont' use libraries test infrastructure.  Just normal arcade xunit support.
    
    * add tools.cdacreadertests subset; add to CLR_Tools_Tests test leg
    
    * no duplicate fields/sizes in types
    
    * Make all cdacreader.csproj ProjectReferences use the same AdditionalProperties
    
       Since we set Configuration and RuntimeIdentifier, if we don't pass the same AdditionalProperties in all ProjectReferences, we bad project.assets.json files
    
    * Don't share the native compilation AdditionalProperties
