    fix (#94249)
    
    in process_remaining_regions, if we haven't gone through the while loop to handle the regions with pinned plugs, we can end up with current_region being an SIP region. then we mistakenly call decide_on_demotion_pin_surv which can change its planned generation. I'm filtering this out before we call decide_on_demotion_pin_surv because the pinned survival in an SIP region is always 0 so we wouldn't want decide_on_demotion_pin_surv to treat it as "to be empty".
