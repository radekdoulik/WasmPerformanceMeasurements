    Implementation of SOSDacApi GetMethodDescName for cDAC (#106169)
    
    Add a number of new `MethodDesc` contract definitions
    
    | Contract algorithm on RuntimeTypeSystem |
    | --- |
    | `IsGenericMethodDefinition`|
    |`GetGenericMethodInstantiation`|
    |`GetMethodToken`|
    |`IsArrayMethod`|
    |`IsDynamicMethod`|
    |`IsStoredSigMethodDesc`|
    |`IsNoMetadataMethod`|
    |`IsILStub`|
    
    Update cDAC compat asserts in cDAC to always be enabled by using a tls variable in `mscordaccore`
    
    Implement `GetMethodDescName` on `ISOSDacInterface` in the `cdacreader`
    
    Stub out an implementation of `GetPath` in the `Loader` contract used in a fallback after a fallback. This will need further work, but is included to make sure the code path isn't lost.
    
    Fix the `EcmaMetadataReader` to be able to find blobs in the metadata
    
    Add ability to read target data from a buffer held on the cdac side using the `Target` class. This was needed to handle signature containing a `CorElementType.Internal`.
    
    And finally actually implement the name generation algorithm via a line for line port from the CoreCLR codebase.
