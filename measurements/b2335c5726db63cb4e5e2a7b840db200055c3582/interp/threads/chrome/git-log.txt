    Switch patchpoint key to <func version, IL offset> (#114381)
    
    This PR changes the patchpoint key to be a pair <function
    version, IL offset> instead of by IP of the return address. This is in
    preparation for runtime async changes where suspension inside OSR
    methods have to be resumed via resumption stub -> tier 0 -> OSR method.
    The latter step needs to retransition into the right OSR method from the
    tier 0 resumption code. With the current key this is problematic
    because the return address is not going to be the same as the original
    patchpoint that induced the OSR transition.
