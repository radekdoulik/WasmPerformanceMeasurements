    Fix generation of minidump (#115562)
    
    This PR addresses a minidump generation issue by wrapping IL version method calls with a try-catch block to ensure that an exception in GetIL doesnâ€™t prevent dumping a full callstack.
    
    Wraps GetIL and related ILCodeVersion calls in an exception block
    Uses EX_CATCH_RETHROW_ONLY_COR_E_OPERATIONCANCELLED to selectively rethrow only specific exceptions
