    Handle calls to shared generic interfaces from shared generic code (#117210)
    
    - The implementation uses the true LDVIRTFTN path for this. Since it thunks to using function pointer the perf is likely not ideal, but we will need a new generic dictionary entry kind to make this simple, and I'd like to avoid making that change to unblock progress here
    - This expensive path was probably fine for use with virtual generic methods, but regular interface dispatch shouldn't be this expensive, so we'll want to fix this later
