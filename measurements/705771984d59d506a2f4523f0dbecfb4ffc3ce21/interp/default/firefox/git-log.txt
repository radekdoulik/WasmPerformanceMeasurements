    Revert change to follow symlinks of dotnet host  (#115315)
    
    https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/99576 changed the host to first
    resolve symlinks before resolving the application directory. This means
    that relative loads happen relative to the pointed-at file, not the
    symbolic link. This was a breaking change made to match the symbolic
    link behavior on all platforms.
    
    Unfortunately, it seems a number of users have taken a dependency on the
    Windows-specific behavior. This PR reverts the change and puts back in
    place the old Windows behavior.
