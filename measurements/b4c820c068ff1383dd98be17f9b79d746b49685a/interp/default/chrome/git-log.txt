    Allow devirt into abstract classes if we saw a non-abstract child (#108379)
    
    We avoid devirtualizing into abstract classes because whole program view might have optimized away the method bodies and devirtualizing them doesn't lead to anything good.
    
    However, if the whole program view had a non-abstract child of this, we can no longer optimize this out and devirtualization should be fine.
