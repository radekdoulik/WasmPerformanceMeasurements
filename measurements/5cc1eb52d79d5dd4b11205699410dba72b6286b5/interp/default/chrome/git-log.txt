    Packaging: Port fix for GetParts from .NETFramework (#108681)
    
    * Packaging: Port fix for GetParts from .NETFramework
    
    This ports a fix for the `GetParts` method to improve part URI handling and collision detection.
    
    `src/libraries/System.IO.Packaging/src/System/IO/Packaging/Package.cs`: Added sorting of parts array to ensure proper order, introduced a dictionary and list to track parts and detect collisions, and implemented a new method `CopyPartDictionaryToPartList` to copy parts to `_partList`.
    
    * Fix regression in ExtensionEqualityComparer
    
    Previously this comparison was Ordinal after calling ToUpperInvariant
    
    This was changed to InvariantIgnoreCase which breaks because it will
    treat things like ÃŸ and ss as equal where they were not before.
    
    * Address feedback
    
    * Remove servicing properties from IO.Packaging
