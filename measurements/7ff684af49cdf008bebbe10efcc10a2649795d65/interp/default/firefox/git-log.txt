    Ensure the layout of `StackAllocatedBox<T>` matches boxed layouts (#107050)
    
    The boxed layout of a struct always has its data at +8, as evidenced by
    `Object::UnBox`. This means that `StackAllocatedBox<T>` should have
    `Pack = 1`, otherwise this may not be the case. In the test failure we
    had a `StackAllocatedBox<Int128>` which had its `_value` field at offset
    16. After object stack allocation this meant that we were saving data in
    padding of the structure, which promotion does not guarantee to
    preserve.
    
    Fix #106947
