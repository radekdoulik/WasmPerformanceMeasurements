    [mono] CodeQL fix set #1 (#99637)
    
    CodeQL flagged various places where we're dereferencing pointers that could be NULL, this PR systematically cleans some of them up via g_assert.
    * g_assert result of g_build_path calls
    * Allocation failure handling
    * mono_class_inflate_generic_class_checked can return NULL
