    JIT: initial profile repair (#100456)
    
    Always run a repair pass after incorporating profile data. If that fails to converge, blend in synthetic likelihoods in increasing strengths to enable convergence (giving up some accuracy).
    
    Enable block weight consistency checks to run right after profile incorporation. Disable just after that.
    
    We can generally make profile data self-consistent, save for two exceptions:
    1. if the flow graph contains an infinite (or effectively infinite) loop
    2. if the IL is invalid
    
    Because of (2) we can't immediately assert if the profile is not consistent; we must defer until after we've successfully imported the method (since the importer contains many of the validity checks).
