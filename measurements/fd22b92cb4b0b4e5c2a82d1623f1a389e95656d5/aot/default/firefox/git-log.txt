    Remove preventing EH and entering EE at shutdown (#100293)
    
    * Remove preventing EH and entering EE at shutdown
    
    Historically, the runtime was trying to block handling exceptions,
    entering EE and other stuff during shutdown of the runtime. We have
    already removed most of that in the past, since it has been a deadlock
    farm. While debugging a customer issue, I have found that we are still
    preventing some things to happen during shutdown. We stop handling
    exceptions at all and we also prevent entering EE at few places.
    This change removes these, as the plan we've been on is to keep the
    runtime running until the OS itself stops the process.
    In the customer's case, the problem was that during a machine
    shutdown, .NET runtime was generating watson dump due to an unhandled
    exception stemming from a network socket related code that would otherwise
    be handled.
