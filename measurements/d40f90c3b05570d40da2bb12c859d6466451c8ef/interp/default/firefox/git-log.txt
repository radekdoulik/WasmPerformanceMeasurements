    Implement support for `InlineArray` in the trimmer (#92060)
    
    Types annotated with `InlineArray` need to preserve all of their fields, even if otherwise this would not be the case. It's possible to have a struct with `LayoutKind.Auto` and with `InlineArray` - trimmer would normally trim fields on such struct. This leads to corruption since the field is never accessed directly.
    
    This changes the marking to preserve all fields on a type with `InlineArray` attribute just like we would for explicit layout struct and similar other types.
    
    Adds tests to cover both the explicit usage of `InlineArray` attribute as well as the compiler generate usage via collection literals.
