    * ilasm: Haiku build fixes
    
    Some OSes like Haiku define the `_EXPORT` and `_IMPORT` marcos.
    
    Symbols beginning with an underscore followed immediately by an
    uppercase letter are reserved anyway.
    
    Add the guards to get them out of the way.
    
    * pal: Remove usage of MAP_FILE
    
    This flag is a compatibility flag and not required on most OSes.
    Some, including Haiku, does not even define it.
