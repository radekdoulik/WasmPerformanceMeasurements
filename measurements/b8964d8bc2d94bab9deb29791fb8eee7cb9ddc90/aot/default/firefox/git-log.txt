    Fix WinDbg first chance exception notification (#100714)
    
    With the new EH enabled, WinDbg couldn't recognize a first chance
    exception since it bases that on RaiseException monitoring and the new
    EH doesn't use SEH.
    
    This change fixes that by raising and immediatelly catching an exception
    of EXCEPTION_COMPLUS type if a debugger is attached.
