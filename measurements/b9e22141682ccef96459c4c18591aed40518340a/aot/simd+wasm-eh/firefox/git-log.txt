    [mini] Disable passing valuetypes in SIMD registers (#74582)
    
    Partially reverts https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/68991
    
    When LLVM code calls non-LLVM code it will pass arguments in SIMD
    registers which the non-LLVM code doesn't expect
    
    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/73454 (issue 1)
