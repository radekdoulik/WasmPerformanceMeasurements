    Update suppression reason for Assembly.GetType call (#105577)
    
    With https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/104060 there will be
    trim warnings whenever a non-qualified type name is used with
    this API, so the call to `_type.AssemblyGetType` is effectively
    unreachable in a trimmed app with no trim warnings and it is safe
    to suppress.
