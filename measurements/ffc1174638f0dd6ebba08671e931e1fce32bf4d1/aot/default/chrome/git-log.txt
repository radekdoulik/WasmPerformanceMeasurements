    Fix computing available memory on OSX for GC (#97102)
    
    * Fix computing available memory on OSX for GC
    
    We were using the `vm_statistics_data_t::free_count` as the available memory
    reported to the GC. It turned out this value is only a small portion of the
    available memory and that the appropriate value should be based on the
    kern.memorystatus_level value obtained using sysctl. That value represents percentual
    amount of available memory, so multiplying it by the total memory bytes gets
    the available memory bytes.
    
    Close #94846
    
    * Reflect PR feeback and move total memory computation to init
