    Fix maintenance of `genReturnBB` pointer (#96935)
    
    If the `genReturnBB` block is split, the pointer needs
    to be updated.
    
    Without this, we ended up with a situation where the
    `genReturnBB` did not point to the return block, leading to
    omitting the code to remove the PInvoke frame from the thread's
    Frame list.
    
    Fixes #96409
