    [interp] Reverse p/invoke (#119133)
    
    
    * Implements GetStubContext intrinsic in the interpreter
    * For interpreted reverse p/invoke stubs, we ensure that TheUMEntryPrestubWorker runs for every invocation so that it can capture the hidden argument in a thread local. The interpreter can then recover the hidden argument from the thread local in order to offer it via GetStubContext later.
    * Upon entry to interpreted methods that accept a hidden argument, we store the hidden argument (that was saved by the um entry prestub worker) into a special local that can be read from later by calls to GetStubContext.
