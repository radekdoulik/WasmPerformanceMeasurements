    JIT: Refactor 3-opt utilities to facilitate expansion (#109982)
    
    Part of #107749. Follow-up to #103450. To facilitate implementing a global variant of 3-opt alongside the greedy variant, this moves some shared components to helper methods. I want to do this as a separate PR to ensure this change is truly no-diff, and has minimal (if any) TP impact.
