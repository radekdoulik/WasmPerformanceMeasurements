    Add ActiveIssue Annotations to Failing TestReadyToRun Tests and Reenable the Executables (#96721)
    
    * Add "ActiveIssue" annotation placeholders to the failing tests, and
    reenable their respective executables, so that the other tests in said
    run can be executed.
    
    * Added "ActiveIssue" annotation to failing Threading test.
    
    * Added the ActiveIssue annotation to AppDomain.cs
    
    * Added the ActiveIssue template in FileSystemWatcher.File.Move.cs
    
    * Commented out an ActiveIssue annotation because I need to check on
    something in CI.
    
    * Reenabled another failing test because I need to see it in CI.
    
    * Yet another test being weird...
    
    * Disabled some Serialization tests after confirming in CI that they indeed not work.
    
    * Removed unneeded? commented out ActiveIssue annotation.
