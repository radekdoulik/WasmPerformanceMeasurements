    Try making {Try}GetAlternateLookup instance methods on Dictionary/HashSet (#106107)
    
    We made them extension methods instead of instance methods to avoid potential native code size bloat. But the ergonomics of using these without partial generic inference is a bit painful, and we've had reports that it makes them harder to understand. This moves them to be instance methods, and we'll measure the impact on code size to re-evaluate the decision.
