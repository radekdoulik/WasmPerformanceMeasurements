    JIT: Produce correctly typed IR in TLS helper expansion (#108836)
    
    The TLS helper expansion would produce `ADD(long, int)` trees like
    ```
    ▌  STORE_LCL_VAR long   V01 rat0
    └──▌  ADD       long
       ├──▌  ADD       long
       │  ├──▌  LCL_VAR   long   V02 rat1
       │  └──▌  CNS_INT   int    72 $41
       └──▌  CNS_INT   long   192
    ```
    
    which is not legal IR. Fix that by inserting a cast. Also do some more
    aggressive folding to get rid of these casts in the normal cases, and to
    fold some constant arithmeticf in other cases.
