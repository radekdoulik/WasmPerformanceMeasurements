    SPMI: Hacky workaround for coredistools unsupported instructions (#91668)
    
    We currently are unable to get SPMI diffs for methods that use ldapur
    instructions as our current coredistools does not support this
    instruction. While we wait for coredistools to be updated (this was
    blocked on some C++ lib issues) here is a hacky temporary workaround for
    the problem. It rewrites ldapur* instructions into the corresponding
    ldur* instruction before passing it to the near differ.
