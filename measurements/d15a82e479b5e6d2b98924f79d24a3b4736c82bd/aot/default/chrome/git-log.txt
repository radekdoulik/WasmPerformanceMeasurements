    Fix blob and symbol package publishing (#113377)
    
    * Fix metadata updating for symbol packages to ensure we still publish them
    
    * Fix symbol package folders and publish VSSetup as shipping (as requested by upstack folks)
    
    * Don't process symbol packages for the manifest packages. They're just duplicates.
    
    * Fix publishing the asset manifest for source build (needed for SB intermediates)
    
    * Fix input job for some artifacts
