    Emulate shell exit code behavior for signals in PAL (#104902)
    
    The PAL versions of `GetExitCodeProcess` and `WaitForMultipleObjects`
    currently just fake up an exit code using `EXIT_FAILURE` (usually 1)
    whenever a child process is terminated by a signal. This PR changes the
    logic to instead behave the same as most shells and
    `SystemNative_WaitPidExitedNoHang`, where the exit code becomes 128 +
    signal number.
