    Fix FP state restore on macOS exception forwarding (#109458)
    
    The change that enabled AVX512 support in the past has introduced a subtle
    issue in restoring context for forwarding hardware exceptions that occur
    in 3rd party non-managed code. In that case, the restored floating point
    state is garbled.
    
    The problem is due to the fact that we pass a x86_avx512_state context to
    the thread_set_state. That context contains a header field describing the
    format of the context (it can be AVX, AVX512, 32 or 64 bit, ...). That is
    then followed by the actual context structure. This style of context is
    identified e.g. by x86_AVX_STATE flavor. The header field contains the
    specific flavor, which would be x86_AVX_STATE64 or x86_AVX512_STATE64.
    The thread_set_state uses the flavor to detect whether the context passed
    to it is this combined one or just x86_AVX_STATE64 or x86_AVX512_STATE64
    which doesn't have the header field.
    The issue was that while we were passing in the combined context, we were
    passing in the flavor extracted from its header. So the thread_set_state
    used the header as part of the context. That resulted e.g. in xmm register
    contents being shifted by 8 bytes, thus garbling the state.
