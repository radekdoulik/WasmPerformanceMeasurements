    Parallelize superpmi-diffs pipeline per collection (#106759)
    
    This PR changes superpmi-diffs such that it submits a Helix work item for each
    collection that we will be collecting asm diffs or tp diffs for.
    - Add a partition generation step to `superpmi_diffs_setup.py` that creates a
      .json file for every (target OS, target arch, collection) tuple
    - Switch the Helix msbuild project to create partitions based on each of these
      .json files
    - Add a `--summary_as_json` CLI arg to `superpmi.py asmdiffs/tpdiff`. When
      passed, `superpmi.py` will output the information necessary to generate a .md
      summary as JSON instead. These JSON files are now the results of the Helix
      work items.
    - Add a `superpmi.py summarize` command. This command takes a collection of JSON
      summary files and generates a consolidated .md summary in the same format as
      before.
    - Teach `superpmi_diffs_summarize.py` to consolidate the JSON summaries created
      for each (target OS, target arch, collection) tuple into a consolidated .md
      for each (target OS, target arch), before doing the final consolidation to the
      single overall (host OS, host arg) .md file that is shown on AzDO.
    
    With this PR superpmi-diffs is significantly faster. Actual time spent doing
    useful work (building and running superpmi) is only around 30 minutes total. The
    remaining CI time is spent waiting for AzDO runners to pick up the pipeline
    jobs, and for the Helix queues to pick up the Helix work items. An end-to-end
    superpmi-diffs run takes a little over 1 hour now, in comparison to up to 3
    hours before.
