    Fix RidAssetResolution to open shared framework file with read share access (#107112)
    
    The `RidAssetResolution` test was reading Microsoft.NETCoreApp.deps.json in a non-shareable way, which could result in other tests failing when trying to run an application (since that reads the .deps.json). This changes the test to open with `FileShare.Read` by going through `File.OpenRead`.
    
    The other two I just switched to `File.OpenRead` from `File.Open` with the equivalent arguments for consistency with the rest of HostModel and host tests.
