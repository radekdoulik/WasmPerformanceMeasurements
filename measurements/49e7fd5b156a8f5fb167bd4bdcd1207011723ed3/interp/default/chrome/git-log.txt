    Make TooDeepJsonDocument test more consistent across platforms (#105445)
    
    * Make TooDeepJsonDocument test more consistent across platforms
    
    Run the test on a thread with as consistent a stack size as possible so that we don't inadvertently succeed due to having a really large stack.
    
    * Disable test on mono
