    Fixing the InstructionSetDesc implications (#86486)
    
    * Fixing the InstructionSetDesc implications
    
    * Adding more NAOT smoke tests covering the missed instruction sets
    
    * Simplify the HasInstructionSet(Avx512F) check in compSetProcessor
    
    * Fixing the NAOT smoke tests
    
    * Fixing some stale comments
    
    * Fixing build failure
    
    * Ensure the X86Serialize test lambda returns a bool
    
    * Fixing build failure
    
    * Ensure AVX2 isn't opportunistically supported and that dynamic checks work correctly for Vector128/256/512.IsHardwareAccelerated
    
    * Ensure Avx512Vbmi has [Intrinsic] on the right members
    
    * Fix the secondary isIsaSupported check to be properly opportunistic for NAOT
    
    * Ensure vpermb is covered
    
    * Allow opportunistic AvxVnni when Avx2 is opted into
    
    * Don't expect opportunistic Avx2 or AvxVnni in the smoke tests
    
    * Ensure Avx2.X64 checks ExpectedAvx2, not ExpectedAvx
    
    * Change the filter the AVX512 NAOT smoke test on OSX
    
    * Updating the CPUID test to cover new ISAs and correctly validate the hierarchy
    
    * Add two more NAOT smoke tests which cover explicit ISA exclusion
    
    * Add additional CpuId validation covering R2R scenarios using various ISA opt-in
    
    * Ensure new R2R tests actually use R2R
    
    * Don't try to expose an invalid --instruction-set combination
    
    * Ensure xarch r2r tests only run on xarch
    
    * Don't compare manufacturer name of CPUID 0x00000000 to 0x80000000
    
    * Filter out the CPUID test on Mono and account for AVX-512 being unsupported on MacOS
