    Delete vestiges of unused assembly formats (#113646)
    
    * Vestigial support for loading assemblies in IL format
    * Vestigial support for "overflow scopes" in native metadata, which is something we had in .NET Native at some point I guess (ability to split metadata for a single assembly into multiple native modules?)
