    `TensorPrimitives` XML docs: `MinNumber`/`ReciprocalSqrt`/`ReciprocalSqrtEstimate` oversights (#109889)
    
    * Fix XML docs for `MinNumber`
    
    They ware accidentally referring to maxima
    
    * Add `T.Sqrt` to XML docs of reciprocal square root
    
    The effective code was copied from the other reciprocal
