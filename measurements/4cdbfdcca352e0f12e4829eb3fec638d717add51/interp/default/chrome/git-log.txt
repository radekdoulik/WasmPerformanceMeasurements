    [NRBF] More bug fixes (#107682)
    
    - Don't use `Debug.Fail` not followed by an exception (it may cause problems for apps deployed in Debug)
    - avoid Int32 overflow
    - throw for unexpected enum values just in case parsing has not rejected them
    - validate the number of chars read by BinaryReader.ReadChars
    - pass serialization record id to ex message
    - return false rather than throw EndOfStreamException when provided Stream has not enough data
    - don't restore the position in finally
    - limit max SZ and MD array length to Array.MaxLength, stop using LinkedList<T> as List<T> will be able to hold all elements now
    - remove internal enum values that were always illegal, but needed to be handled everywhere
    - Fix DebuggerDisplay
