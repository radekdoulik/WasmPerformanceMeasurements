    JIT: Clean up liveness (#103809)
    
    We have a DFS tree available in both early liveness and SSA's liveness,
    and we can use it to make the data flow cheaper by running in an RPO
    over the DFS tree. This allows us to propagate the maximal amount of
    knowledge in each iteration and also to stop the data flow early when
    there is no cycle in the DFS tree.
    
    We do not have the DFS tree available in lowering where we also call
    liveness. However, lowering was already iterating all blocks to remove
    dead blocks; switch this to `fgDfsBlocksAndRemove` to remove dead blocks
    and compute the DFS tree in one go, and remove the old code doing this.
    
    Additionally there was a bunch of logic in liveness to consider debug
    scopes for debug codegen, left-over from a time where we tracked GC
    pointers even in MinOpts. This code can be deleted since we do not do
    liveness in MinOpts anymore.
