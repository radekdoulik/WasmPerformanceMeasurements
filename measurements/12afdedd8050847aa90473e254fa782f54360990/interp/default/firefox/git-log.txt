    Fix `GetHardwareIntrinsicId` on 32bit platforms (#110238)
    
    AFAIK methods on the nested X64/Arm64 classes shouldn't be considered intrinsics on 32bit platforms since they are as relevant as e.g. WASM intrinsics. This should fix widespread runtime-nativeaot-outerloop failure on x86. I think this regressed in #109137.
