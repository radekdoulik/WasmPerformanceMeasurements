    Add basic support for folding SIMD intrinsics (#81547)
    
    * Create a helper ValueNumStore::EvalHWIntrinsicFunBinary
    
    * Adding some basic support for folding SIMD unary and binary operations
    
    * Refactor SIMD constant folding logic to not depend on C++ 14
    
    * Apply formatting patch
    
    * Handle identity folding for simd add/sub
    
    * Add some basic tests covering SIMD constant folding
    
    * Move genTreeOps to its own header so simd.h can use it in Evaluate*Simd
    
    * Applying formatting patch
