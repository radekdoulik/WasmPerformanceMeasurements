    [cdac][tests] Make it easier to set up a unit test (#108288)
    
    We used to stackalloc a lot of data because the Target callback had to be an UnmanagedCallersOnly function pointer. But now it's just a delegate. So we can heap allocate the mock memory space and get rid of a bunch of incidental fixed statements
    We used to spell out the JSON contract descriptor in every test case. We dont' need to do that - most tests are not testing parsing. Hide all that stuff in MockMemorySpace.Builder
    
    * make MockMemorySpace.ReadContext a class
    
       Now that Target's reader callback is just a normal managed delegate, we don't have a lot of reason to make the testing ReadContext a ref struct.  So simplify our resource usage and just store the descriptors and json as heap allocated arrays
    
    * remove uses of fixed in tests
    
       The ReadContext for the  tests keeps a copy of the json payload, we don't need to use unmanaged pointers
    
    * make the MockMemorySpace.Builder a normal class
    
       we don't hold pointers to span data anymore
    
    * make MockMemorySpace.ReadContext private
    
    * begin hiding ContractDescriptorFill
    
       most of our tests that use a valid contract descriptor don't need to repeat the boilerplate to fill it in
    
    * start removing json and pointer data boilerplate
    
    * Don't fill the pointer data when there isn't any
    
       We previously did the wrong thing with TargetTestHelpers.MakeGlobalJson: it always filled in direct values.  So technically filling in the pointer data in all the other tests is unnecessary.
    
       Add a second SetGlobals overload for the builder that takes a 4-tuple (either ulong? Value or uint IndirectIndex) and a second collection of actual values for the indices.
    
    * remove unused MockMemorySpace.Builder functions
    
       everything is using high level construction now
    
    * remove unneeded stackalloc
    
    * describe test addresses
