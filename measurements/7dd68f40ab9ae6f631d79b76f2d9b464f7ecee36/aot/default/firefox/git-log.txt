    JIT: Have lowering set up IR for post-indexed addressing and make strength reduced IV updates amenable to post-indexed addressing (#105185)
    
    * JIT: Have lowering set up IR for post-indexed addressing
    
    This adds a transformation in lowering that tries to set up the IR to be
    amenable to post-indexed addressing in the backend. It does so by
    looking for RMW additions/subtractions of a local that was also recently
    used as the address to an indirection.
    
    * JIT: Make strength reduced IV updates amenable to post-indexed addressing
    
    On arm64 have strength reduction try to insert IV updates after the last
    use if that last use is a legal insertion point. This often allows the
    backend to use post-indexed addressing to combine the use with the IV
    update.
