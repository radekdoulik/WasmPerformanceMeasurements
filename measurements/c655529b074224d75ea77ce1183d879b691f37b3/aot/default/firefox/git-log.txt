    pal init: Move InitializeFlushProcessWriteBuffers() after VIRTUALInitialize() (#107100)
    
    A fixup of commit 27ee590d that's broken on platforms which don't
    support membarrier() syscall: GetVirtualPageSize() is called in the
    fallback path of InitializeFlushProcessWriteBuffers() and attempts to
    mmap() zero bytes.
    
    Move InitializeFlushProcessWriteBuffers() after VIRTUALInitialize() but
    before the first thread is created.
