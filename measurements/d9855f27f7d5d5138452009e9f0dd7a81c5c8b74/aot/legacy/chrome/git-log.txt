    Fix obtaining type handles of IDynamicInterfaceCastableImplementation (#109875)
    
    Fixes #109496.
    
    We try to optimize away type handles (MethodTables) of types that are only needed due to metadata. Trying to grab type handle of such type throws. This fixes it by unconditionally generating type handles of IDynamicInterfaceCastableImplementation.
