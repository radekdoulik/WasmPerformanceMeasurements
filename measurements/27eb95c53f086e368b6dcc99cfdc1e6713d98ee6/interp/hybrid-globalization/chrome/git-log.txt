    Cleanup only changes (#91445)
    
    Cleanup only changes
    
    + fixed compiler errors for when BACKGROUND_GC is not defined
    
    + made a few things only defind when USE_REGIONS is not defined as they are only used for segments case
    
    + fixed an AV in a dprintf in descr_generations that @cshung noticed
    
    + reverted the dprintf change I accidently left in a previous PR that @mrsharm noticed
    
    + got rid of some unused methods
    
    + got rid of some useless, obsolete or wrong comments and move the finalize lock comment to an appropriate place
    
    + fixed some inappropriate line width, inconsistent formatting, unused args/fields and typos
      there are other inconsistent formating like spacing but there are many so they should be in their own PR to not completely dwarf changes in this one.
