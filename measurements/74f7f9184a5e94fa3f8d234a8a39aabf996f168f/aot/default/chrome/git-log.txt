    JIT: fix permute node type in AVX simd sum (#103680)
    
    In `gtNewSimdSumNode` we need to type permute nodes as `simd16`, not the sum's type.
    If we split the tree at the permute we spill to the wrong typed temp.
    
    Also provide the ability to halt stress tree splitting after some number of splits.
    
    Fixes #102335.
