    Make host trace to `<exe_name>.<pid>.log` if `COREHOST_TRACEFILE` is set to a directory (#114362)
    
    Currently, host tracing can output to a file specified by the `COREHOST_TRACEFILE` environment variable. With multiple concurrent processes, the tracing gets interleaved in the resulting log.
    
    With this change, if `COREHOST_TRACEFILE` is set to a directory that exists, the host will trace to a file named `<exe_name>.<pid>.log` in that directory. If the specified path does not exist or is not a directory, the host uses the existing behavior of tracing to the file specified.
