    JIT: enable removal of try/catch if the try can't throw. (#110273)
    
    If no tree in the try region of a try/catch can throw, then
    we can remove the try and delete the catch.
    
    If no tree in the try region of a try/finally can throw, we can
    remove the try and inline the finally. This slightly generalizes
    the empty-try/finally opt we have been doing for a long time.
    (We should do something similar for try/fault, but don't, yet).
    
    Since these optimization passes are cheap, and opportunities
    for them arise after other optimizations and unblock subsequent
    optimizations, run them early, middle, and late.
    
    Resolves #107191.
    
    I expect we'll see more of these cases in the future, say if
    we unblock cloning of loops with EH.
