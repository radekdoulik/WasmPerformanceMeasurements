    Extract HMAC.HashData{Async} into HMACStatic
    
    * Move the HashData and HashDataAsync implementations to HMACStatic so we can deduplicate all of the parameter checking and implementation.
    
    * Move the platform checks in to HMACStatic for SHA-3. This revealed an issue with Verify - we were doing the platform check before the parameter checks. The throw order between HashData and Verify is now consistent.
