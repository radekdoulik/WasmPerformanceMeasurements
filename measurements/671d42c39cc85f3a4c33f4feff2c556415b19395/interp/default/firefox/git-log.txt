    JIT: Fix invalid zero-init suppression for untracked variables (#91580)
    
    optRemoveRedundantZeroInits has logic to remove unnecessary zero inits
    if we can determine that the local will be zeroed in the prolog. In
    addition, it also has logic to suppress the prolog zero init if there is
    a dominating initialization already. The latter logic was trying to
    reason about liveness for untracked locals, which does not make sense.
    
    Fix #91576
