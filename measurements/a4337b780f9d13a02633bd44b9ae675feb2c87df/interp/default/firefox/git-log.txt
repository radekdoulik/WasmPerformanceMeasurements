    Remove `IlcKeepManagedDebuggerSupport` (#101369)
    
    This was introduced in #82696, but on a second thought, we should be able to use the documented `DebuggerSupport` for this. We still don't want to full on default this to `false` for reasons described in the PR, but the explicit value of `true` can be the escape hatch.
