    Add -cross flag to build.ps1 (#100678)
    
    Fixes VMR build error on Windows after https://github.com/dotnet/installer/pull/19321
    
    We haven't used or passed this on Windows before and a bunch of logic is conditioned based on the `CrossBuild` property (which is what `-cross` is turned into in build.sh) so ignore it for now.
