    JIT: tolerate unreachable callfinallies during EH removal (#111668)
    
    If we unexpectedly see multiple (likely unreachable) callfinallies from an
    empty try, just defer optimizing away the try. Now that we run multiple
    passes of EH removal, we will  redo the opt later once flow opts have cleaned
    up those unreachable blocks.
    
    Fixes #111617
