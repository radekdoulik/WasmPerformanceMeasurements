    SPMI: Always enable venv for coreclr_tests.run collection (#107133)
    
    Otherwise if the Helix run failed (because of a failing test) we won't
    run this step, which will cause the next steps to fail. This is
    currently happening for collections internally. The other places where
    we enable Python venv already have this `condition: always()`.
