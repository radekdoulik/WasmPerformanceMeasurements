    JIT: Refactor CSE candidate storage slightly (#116009)
    
    CSE candidates had separate storage for the first candidate and
    subsequent candidates. This introduces some awkwardness when adding the
    second candidate to the list.
    
    Refactor things so that the first candidate is stored inline in `CSEdsc`
    as a normal list entry.
