    React to CheckForOverflowUnderflow in regex source generator (#78228)
    
    * React to CheckForOverflowUnderflow in regex source generator
    
    The regex source generator uses code patterns that might have arithmetic overflows, e.g. a bounds check with `(uint)index < span.Length`.  These are intentional, and they're benign... unless the project/compilation has opted-in to overflow/underflow checking (CheckForOverflowUnderflow).  In that case, the code for many patterns can start throwing false positive overflow exceptions, making the source generator unusable.
    
    This commit causes the generator to look at the CheckOverflow setting in the compilation options, and if it's set, to emit `unchecked { ... }` around all the relevant code.
