    [Wasm] Update boot.json manifest generation order (#99525)
    
    * [Wasm] Update boot.json manifest generation order
    * Use DefineStaticWebAssets to update publish assets
    
    In preparation for the static web assets update to generate fingerprinted
    files, there is a requirement that static web assets are generated before
    they are defined.
    
    This is because each asset now carries two new properties:
    * Fingerprint: Which is a path friendly unique version of the SHA256 hash
    * Integrity: Which is the Base64 SHA256 hash of the asset.
