    Add instructions to debug CLI builds using VS (#108455)
    
    Adds instructions to use VS as a tool to debug CLI builds
    
    Previously the coreclr debugging docs only mentioned workflows for Visual Studio
    which involve using VS for both building and debugging. This adds an additional
    method to build using CLI scripts and use VS to only debug.
    
    Thank you @AaronRobinsonMSFT for showing me this method.
