    Fix physical promotion scenario name and a couple of bugs (#85343)
    
    This was renamed but I forgot to update these occurrences. The result is
    that runtime-jit-experimental is not actually running with physical
    promotion enabled.
    
    Also fix a couple of bugs that made it in in the meantime.
