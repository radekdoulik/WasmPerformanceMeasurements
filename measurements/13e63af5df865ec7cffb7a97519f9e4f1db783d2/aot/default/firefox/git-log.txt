    Remove synchronization from Http2Connection.ExtendWindow (#97878)
    
    _pendingWindowUpdate is the only state the ExtendWindow method touches under the lock. There is no other code that reads or writes _pendingWindowUpdate after the creation of the connection object. Originating from ProcessIncomingFramesAsync, calls to ExtendWindow are sequential, and never expected to happen concurrently.
