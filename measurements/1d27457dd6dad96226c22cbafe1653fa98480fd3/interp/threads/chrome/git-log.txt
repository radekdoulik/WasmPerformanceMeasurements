    Support field access on GetType() of T constrained to be Enum (#105351)
    
    Adds trimming support for instance.GetType().GetFields(), where
    instance is a variable of type `T` that is constrained to System.Enum.
    
    This includes a change to have ILLink's TypeProxy track a
    TypeReference instead of TypeDefinition, which was necessary to allow
    TypeProxy to represent a generic parameter.
    
    Note that this only supports the specific case where `GetType()` is
    called on a variable of type `T` that is constrained to `Enum`. A
    variable of type `Enum` is not supported, so the following will still
    warn:
    
    
    ```csharp
    static void M(Enum v) {
        v.GetType().GetFields();
    }
    ```
