    Fix VirtualCallStubManager stats capturing on EE shutdown (#102073)
    
    * Fix VirtualCallStubManager stats capturing on EE shutdown
    
    Before this change logging stats to StubLog file doesn't work because on EE shutdown
    we don't shut down manager. Since it's only about logging we can perform uninit earlier.
    
    * Address code review comments
