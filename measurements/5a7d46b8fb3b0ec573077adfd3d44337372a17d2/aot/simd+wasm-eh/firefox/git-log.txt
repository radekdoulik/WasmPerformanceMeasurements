    Wasm jiterpreter cleanup and bug fixes pt. 3 (#78782)
    
        Fix semantics of floating point relops in the jiterpreter. This only causes test failures when the new tier_instantly option is enabled.
        Unroll memmoves in the jiterpreter like memsets in the previous PR
        Turn interp_exec_method back into a static function, and move jiterp code around to enable it to still work. This seems to arbitrarily change the performance of the interpreter (mostly for the worse, but positively on some test cases) on all platforms for some reason even though it shouldn't.
