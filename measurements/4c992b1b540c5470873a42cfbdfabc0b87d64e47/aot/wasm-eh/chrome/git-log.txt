    Changing when the symbols from symbol server is loaded because it takes a long time to load, as there are a lot of assemblies loaded not found on symbol servers.
    
    * use MicrosoftCodeAnalysisCSharpVersion for scripting package.
    
    * Adding more tests as asked by @radical
    Removing timeout change as @radical has split it into 2 files
    Fixing test behavior, when justMyCode is disabled but the symbols are not loaded from symbol server.
    
    * [wasm] some cleanup
    
    - Don't call `UpdateSymbolStore` from `DebugStore..ctor` because that
    gets called multiple times in `LoadStore`, but only once instance gets
    used.
    - Use an isolated symbol cache path per test
    
    * remove debug spew
    
    * Addressing radical comment.
