    JIT: Fix tailcall-to-loop improper locals zeroing (#81083)
    
    The zeroing that the tailcall-to-loop optimization does was zeroing the
    promoted copies for implicit byrefs even when promotion of them was undone.
    This was introducing unexpected references to the promoted fields.
    
    Fix #81081
