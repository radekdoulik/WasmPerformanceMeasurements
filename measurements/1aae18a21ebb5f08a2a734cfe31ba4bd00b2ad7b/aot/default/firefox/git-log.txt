    Error out if SelfContained is not specified for Native AOT publish (#95496)
    
    The SDK has logic to specify SelfContained for PublishAot automatically. Except this doesn't apply when we're using msbuild to run the `Publish` target (`_IsPublishing` is not set): https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/75184c7e763197fa2971954aa5baf70ffd188799/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets#L64-L83
    
    This can lead to a bad failure mode because SelfContained is the thing that ensure ILC gets all the references to assemblies it needs. It will appear to work most of the time even without SelfContained (because ILCompiler packages carries a framework with it), but it will fail for things like ASP.NET.
    
    Enable back the logic that just errors out for this. If someone does `msbuild /t:publish` they'll get an error saying they need to also specify SelfContained instead of some weird failure mode. There was some discussion about this aspect in https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/28714.
