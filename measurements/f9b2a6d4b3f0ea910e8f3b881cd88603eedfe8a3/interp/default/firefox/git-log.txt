    JIT: Optimize for cost instead of score in 3-opt layout (#109741)
    
    Part of #107749. Follow-up to #103450. This refactors 3-opt to minimize layout cost instead of maximizing layout score. This is arguably more intuitive, and it should facilitate implementing a more sophisticated cost model. This PR also adds a mechanism for evaluating the total cost of a given layout, which means we can assert at each move that we actually improved the global layout cost.
