    Interpreter GC info stage 3: Report locals to the GC (#114469)
    
    Allocate stack slot IDs for interp vars and record liveness ranges
    Specialize GetStackSlot for the interpreter because we stash the actual stack location in the frame register
    Handle allocation failure in simdhash
    Add test coverage for structs containing refs
    Patch initlocals once we have allocated offsets so that we zero our vars in addition to IL vars (GC safety)
    Introduce globalVarsStackTop, the high water mark for global vars that might contain refs or interior pointers
    Enable disabled tests
