    Enable GC double reporting detection (#107986)
    
    * Enable GC double reporting detection
    
    This change adds detection of double reporting of stack slots and
    registers during GC stack walk. The detection is disabled by default and
    can be enabled using the DOTNET_EnableGCHoleMonitoring env variable.
    
    If a double reporting is found, it triggers an assert in both release and
    debug builds of the runtime.
