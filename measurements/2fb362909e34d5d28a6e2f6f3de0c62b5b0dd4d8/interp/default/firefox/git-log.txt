    Remove `BaseDomain` use in `LoaderAllocator` and event tracing helpers (#107481)
    
    - Remove `BaseDomain` member on `LoaderAllocator`
      - Add asserts in functions using `AppDomain` that the loader allocator is collectible and the type is `LAT_Assembly` (so `AssemblyLoaderAllocator` which always had `AppDomain`)
    - Remove unnecessary `BaseDomain`/`AppDomain` parameters from event tracing helpers
      - They were always being called with the current app domain
