    JIT: Remove some loop flags (#97314)
    
    - Remove `BBF_OLD_LOOP_HEADER_QUIRK`. It should have been removed with
      the removal of the old loop code.
    - Remove `BBF_LOOP_PREHEADER`. It is not longer necessary to maintain
      this since we do not make any flowgraph changes while we try to keep
      loops incrementally up to date. So the only effect is some
      conservative logic around compaction.
