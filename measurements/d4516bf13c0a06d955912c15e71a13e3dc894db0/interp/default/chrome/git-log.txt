    Temporarily uninstall pkg-config@0.29.2 in install-dependencies.sh (#109968)
    
    This was added by AzDO in https://github.com/actions/runner-images/pull/10971 as a workaround for https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/10984, but that means the old package now conflicts with the new pkg-config which is an alias to pkgconf.
    
    Fixes the build issues we've seen with OSX image version 20241119.505
