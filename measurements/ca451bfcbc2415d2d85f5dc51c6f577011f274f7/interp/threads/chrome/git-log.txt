    [mono] Switch simdhash to prime bucket counts; increase load factor
    
    Add some measurements for simdhash ght
    Introduce scan data that's fetched once per bucket
    Targeted simdhash optimizations via new dn_simdhash_ght_get_value_or_default
    Switch to spaced prime bucket counts instead of power of two bucket counts for better collision resistance
    Fix cache alignment of ght compatible and ptr ptr simdhash variants on 64-bit
    Higher simdhash load factor (closer to ghashtable's; improves performance for bad hashes)
    Add sequential keys measurements
    Increase load factor to 30%
