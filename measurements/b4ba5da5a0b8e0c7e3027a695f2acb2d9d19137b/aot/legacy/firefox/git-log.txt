    A few optimizations for the gcinfodecoder construction (#96150)
    
    * faster ReadOneFast
    
    * lzcnt
    
    * linear search for safepoints
    
    * do not "decode" individual bool flags
    
    * factored out predecoding of fat header
    
    * tweaks and comments
    
    * fix arm64 build
    
    * use intrinsics correctly
    
    * no need to search for safepoints when asked only for interruptibility
    
    * fix for arm
    
    * small tweak for DecodeVarLengthUnsigned
    
    * removed SAFE_SHIFT_LEFT, SAFE_SHIFT_RIGHT
    
    * undo unnecessary change.
