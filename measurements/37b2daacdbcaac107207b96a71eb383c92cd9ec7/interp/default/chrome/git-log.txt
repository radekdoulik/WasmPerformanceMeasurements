    Disable core dumps in host tests that intentionally crash (#116725)
    
    For tests that intentionally crash, we were already clearing out `DOTNET_DbgEnableMiniDump`/`COMPlus_DbgEnableMiniDump`, but OS core dumps were still enabled.
    - In tests that are explicitly throwing an unhandled exception, call into OS APIs to disable dumps for the current process
    - When launching a command that should have dumps disabled, call `ulimit -c 0` before the command (for cases where the test doesn't have control over the process)
    
    For Unix, this avoids creating any dumps for intentional crashes. On Windows, we still have two created for `Muxer_NonAssemblyWithExeExtension` and `UnhandledException_BreadcrumbThreadDoesNotFinish`.
