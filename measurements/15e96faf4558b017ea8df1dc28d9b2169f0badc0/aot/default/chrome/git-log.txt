    JIT: Fix `gtNodeHasSideEffects` checking call arguments (#106185)
    
    `gtNodeHasSideEffects` is meant to check if a node has side effects when
    you exclude its children. However, it was checking arguments of calls
    which is more conservative than expected.
    
    The actual reason we were doing that seems to be `gtTreeHasSideEffects`
    that sometimes wants to ignore `GTF_CALL` on pure helper calls. It was
    relying on this check in `gtNodeHasSideEffect`; instead move it to
    `gtTreeHasSideEffects` where it belongs.
    
    This is an alternative fix for #106129; there we leave a
    `COMMA(CORINFO_HELP_RUNTIMELOOKUP_METHOD, ...)` around because
    extracting side effects from op1 does not end up getting rid of the
    call.
    
    Fix #106129
