    Fix Shuffling Thunks part 2 (#90707)
    
    * Remove running setup-stress-dependencies.sh
    
    That script was removed in commit 7d6b73e9.
    
    * [RISC-V] Fix shuffling floating registers
    
    * Don't offset ShuffleEntry's by 10, because that is likely to go out of bounds.
    * Base for floating argument regs (fa) is 10 on RISC-V, not 1.
    * Src and dst registers in emit fld were reversed
    * Restore arguments stashed in temporary registers
    
    * [RISC-V] Simplify Emit* methods
    
    * Remove unused Emit* methods
    * Centralize instruction creation in *TypeInstr functions to limit the potential for mistakes in hard-coded shifts, masks, etc
    * Replace Emit32 calls with hard-coded opcodes with proper Emit* names.
