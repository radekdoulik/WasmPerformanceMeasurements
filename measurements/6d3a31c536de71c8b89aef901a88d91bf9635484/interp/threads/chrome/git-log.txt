    [wasm] Optimize jiterpreter option table updates (#101207)
    
    The encode-decode-parse flow for the options JSON wastes some time during startup, this approach is a bit faster. The use of a string key still adds some overhead but it's much smaller than the previous overhead, and it's dwarfed by the cost of cwrap/ccall.
