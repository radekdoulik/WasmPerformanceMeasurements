    Convert isExactType check to JIT/EE interface call (#97424)
    
    * Convert isExactType check to JIT/EE interface call
    
    The approximation of isExactType from class flags had false positives (correctness) and false negatives issues. Converting it to JIT/EE interface method fixes them both.
    
    Fixes #97134
    
    * Add test
    
    * Delete canInlineTypeCheck JIT/EE interface method
    
    All implementations return the same constant. Unlikely to be needed again.
