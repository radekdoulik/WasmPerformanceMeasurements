    Additional cleanup and acceleration of the System.Numerics vector and related types (#103527)
    
    * Added SIMD paths for:
    Vector3.Cross(Vector3 vector1, Vector3 vector2)
    Vector3.Transform(Vector3 value, Quaternion rotation)
    
    * Fixed typo
    
    * fixed missing conversion back to Vector3
    added simd paths for quaternion multiplication, division and concatenate
    added simd path for matrix4x4 multiplication
    
    * Implemented feedback
    
    * fixed non static field
    
    * removed whitespace
    
    * Use Vector4.Transform
