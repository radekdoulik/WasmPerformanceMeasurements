    JIT: Propagate LCL_ADDRs into handlers (#109182)
    
    Expand the support for LCL_ADDR propagation to keep assertions around in
    handler blocks when they are true at all points in all predecessor
    blocks of those handlers. This requires keeping track of the "always
    true" assertions for each block.
