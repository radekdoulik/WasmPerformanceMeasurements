    JIT: Simplify `Compiler::getHWIntrinsicImmTypes` (#117784)
    
    Numerous SVE2 PRs have had to expand the checks in this function to catch new intrinsics. These checks aren't necessary for computing the intrinsic's immediates' sizes/types. They are essentially debug checks that are (or ought to be) checked downstream. Removing them simplifies later intrinsic additions, and cleans up the function quite a bit.
