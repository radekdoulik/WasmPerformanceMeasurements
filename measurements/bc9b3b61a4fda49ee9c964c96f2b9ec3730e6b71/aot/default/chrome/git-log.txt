    Fix EH stacktrace keepalive array copy size (#104912)
    
    When the stacktrace keepalive array is grown, we were incorrectly
    copying extra item from the original keepalive array to the new one. In
    some cases, it ended up adding garbage to the array and GC object
    verification has hickuped on it. In the CI, it was only hit by
    GCStress-Extra tests that set DOTNET_HeapVerify=1 so far.
    
    This fixes the copied size to be the source array's number of elements.
    
    Close #104878
