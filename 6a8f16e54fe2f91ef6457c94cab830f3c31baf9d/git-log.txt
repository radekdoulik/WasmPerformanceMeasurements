    Enable server-side OCSP stapling on Linux
    
    This enables OCSP stapling on Linux when the server uses SslStreamCertificateContext instead of just passing the cert.
    
    On Linux, the SslStreamCertificateContext will perform the background fetches of the OCSP payload
    and is responsible for presenting the data to the TLS session during the handshake.
    
    Like other platforms, the OCSP stapling is "best effort" and there's no way to force it to block until ready.
    
    All of the reflection-based HttpClient usage from Linux X509Chain got factored out to a utility type called X509ResourceClient.
