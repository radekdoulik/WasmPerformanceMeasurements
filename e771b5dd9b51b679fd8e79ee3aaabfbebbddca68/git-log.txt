    superpmi.py: Add `-jitoption` for asmdiffs (#70939)
    
    The new `-jitoption` option passes the argument options to both baseline and diff
    compilers. This is a convenience option: there already is `-base_jit_option` and
    `-diff_jit_option` to specify passing options to either baseline or diff.
    
    The name of the option is the same as that used for `replay`.
